The Bible as a whole is the writing collected by Jewish communities from the Persian Period and beyond.

To get to know them, we must let them speak for themselves out of that Otherness.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>_A Critic of the Study of Kinship_ by David Schneider<br/><br/>*   He has two descriptions: The first description and the second description.<br/>*   **First Description**: A tabinau is defined as A patrilocal extended family. A patrilineage is defined by a father... connected by fathers (patri). Everything goes through the father. Second definition of tabinau is A corporate (communal) landholding unit. There were plots of land called binau that were owned as bodies that were defined by tabinau.<br/>*   **Second Description:** The tabinau has different meanings in different contexts. In one context it's a house/dwelling. It was also a person/persons related to the speaker by ties of land. All rank, recognition, job, etc.<br/>*   Land is not owned, even corporately.<br/>*   Land is made by work, what people do to serve it past and present.<br/>*   Kind of like a family structure - people grouped together by the land they live on.<br/>*   The people of the tabinau are past and present so that their spirits can be tied to their land.<br/>*   Land without people is NOT tabinau. People without relationship through land are still tabinau.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>_HW: Emar 31 is a legal document and would have been kept in case of need to prove its provisions.

The period of two kingdoms is arguably the earliest period of Biblical write. The support for this statement comes from the way it was written.<br/>2.  We can't assume the same ideas of Israel and how the people of Yahweh. We can't assume they shared the same stories, ideas of religion, etc.<br/>3.  You can't assume the same story of the past.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**How to become King in Israel:**<br/><br/>1.  To become king in Israel is not dependent on bloodline. The people have to be satisfied, but there is a bit of a bloodline element.  <br/>    <br/><br/>\\* The idea of a Mesiah is a Judah idea that the solution to the future of the world would come through someone of the line of David that would be restored to the throne as the only true ruler.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>_HW: Invent a founder of NYU (no cheating with real history).

If Israel existed, it would be written in these letters. In this time, Eygpt ruled over Canaan. They were written in the language Akkadian. Written in **1350 B.C.E (before Meremphta) and closer to the Exodus**. IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ISRAEL. It only names cities, and insults to people like the Apiru people.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>The Exodus Story:<br/><br/>*     <br/>    <br/><br/>**Things to Remember (Four Points):**<br/><br/>1.  According to this story, Israel is NOT from Canaan nor Eygpt.<br/>2.  Israel came into existence out of conflict with Eygpt (relates to the Moses myth). For a while the Eygptians are seen as the \"bad guy\" and the Canaan people need to escape Eygpt.<br/>3.  Israel had some association with wilderness and they're portrayed as mobile, hurding people, meaning that they are shepards on the move. That is how they are portrayed in the Bible before there is a kingdom.<br/>4.  The founding leader of Israel is not a king.<br/><br/>_HW: Write two paragraphs based on objects you have in your room.

The sons of Jacob are the tribes of Israel. WIth all possible nuances, explain how this text understands ancient Israel. Use the atlas for geography (google it: map of ancient Israel). Compare their names to the actual places._<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Monday, 10/16/17**  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Fact 11: The building blocks of Israel and Judah were families, living and dead combined along with their space.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Things to notice about buriel in ancient Israel:**<br/><br/>1.  There is no difference between Israel and Judah.<br/>2.  There are no cemetaries. Burial does not appear to be a communal act.<br/>3.  They did not burry their dead under houses.<br/>4.  It was focused on preserving bones. Bones all the way. Some kind of connection between bones and length of life after.<br/>5.  It appears that in burials in ancient Israel we only find immediate family no more than three generations in a single tomb.<br/>6.  Generally speaking, burials were just outside of villages and towns.<br/><br/>_HW: Jeurusalem was David's capital, the center of Jeurusalem, the rallying point of Jewish survivors (after it was destroyed), and is still a powerful symbol.

Jerusalem existed before Israel. From the 14th Century we have letters from Jerusalem, not Israel.<br/>2.  Jerusalem keeps the same small scale that it had before Israel when it becomes a capital.<br/>3.  We cannot excavate the temple mount, which is where we would have found both Solomon's Temple and the Royal Palace. We know they are there from descriptions in the Bible.<br/>4.  Jerusalem was first a major city in the 8th century.<br/><br/>\\* Jerusalem is all over the Bible. It is \"Judah's City\". What we know is what the people told us, so we are getting it from their perspective.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Fact 12: Israel's antithesis is Jerusalem, where the center defines the whole.<br/><br/>Meaning that the way we learned about Israel as a name and not as a city, and its basic nature, it is a collection of people and not defined by a center. Jerusalem is the reverse: it is a center that defines a whole.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>1 Samuel<br/><br/>*     <br/>    <br/><br/>2 Samuel 5<br/><br/>*   Jerusalem is David's city.  <br/>    <br/><br/>1 Kings 22<br/><br/>*     <br/>    <br/><br/>Isaiah 6<br/><br/>*   The powers of physical and (something) authority sat next to each other at the table.<br/>*   The sacred and political were separated in ancient Israel.<br/><br/>\\* Every king of Judah was descended from David. There is never any other capital than Jerusalem.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Remember these kings:<br/><br/>1.  Sol - First King with a royal house. NOT RELATED TO DAVID. SON IS JONATHAN.<br/>2.  David<br/>3.  Jeroboam - Portrayed as the beginning of another royal family.<br/>4.  Baasha - Super not famous, doesn't really do anything famous. Represents a new royal family and known for setting up a new capital<br/>5.  Omri<br/>6.  Jehu<br/><br/>\\* Several capitals ending with Samaria.<br/><br/>\\* The very (Jewish) idea of a Mesia is a Jerusalem, Judah idea of the return of the King.

How do they do it, what kinds of struggles do they face? etc. How do you get to be a woman ruler?  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Judges 4 & 5 (song of Deborah) -- Deborah**<br/><br/>*   Through God. Only if God decides to speak to you. _\\* Prophet *_ \"The Lord, the God of Israel, commads you...\" God speaks through her (Deborah).<br/>*   Judges 5:7 - \"Until I arose, a mother in Israel.\"<br/>*   It's a delicate thing to be a woman in leadership.<br/>*   Chapter 5 praises Yahweh, then shifts to call to battle.<br/>*   Collaboration with a man.<br/><br/>Understand about this text:<br/><br/>1.  She is a prophet in chapter 4, and has the role of deciding disputes (judge/leader). She is introduced portrayed with these leadership skills, she doesn't develop them throughout the story. * Think in terms of institutions. * She does have authority, but it is, in some sense, voluntary... because of who she is; it is not institutionalized. The basis for this authority is RELIGIOUS.  <br/>    <br/>2.  Her authority is rooted in perceived access to divine power (God). According ot the Bible, there were no legitimate women prophets.<br/>3.  Deborah is given a husband (Lappidoth) in the beginning. Whether or not he is a husband or not, he has no role in the story. She was not a \"woman of the house\" in any way. Why is she called a mother in Israel? Has nothing to do with being a mother in the way you know it to mean.<br/>4.  The occassion in both chapters is war. Even though she has such authority, the thing that is in view is a military crisis. _\\* Barak is a military commander, but it's kind of like Deborah appointed him just because she needed a male collaboration *_.<br/>5.  Identification of Deborah as a mother only comes in the poem (Song of Deborah). Not in the household. Her being a \"mother\" is a way of explaining the character of her authorities. As a mother, you're not just a mother/queen/tied to a man. She doesn't depend on any man.<br/><br/>\\* Not normal to have this type of authority. Only possible by religious legitimation (she has a direct line to God because of who she is). Not to be duplicated, one time special thing. *<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**2 Kings 11 -- Athaliah**<br/><br/>*   Had to be plausible succession to overthrow her (Athaliah). She is not from the House of David. She was still in the royal family so she was close enough. She is kind of declaring an end to the HOD (House of David).<br/>*   She actually ruled, actually had a lasting effect, ruled for six years.<br/>*   What it took to overthrow her was a plausible return to the royal family. They hid (find name) in a temple and saved him so that he could take over after Athaliah. He was seven years old when he started his reign.<br/><br/>Things to remember about this story.<br/><br/>1.  The story, it's negative, not positive.<br/>2.  There is no divine legitimization. Athaliah does not have God on her side, her power is purely institutional. She only comes to power by the institutions that are in place. (She married into the royal family, is the mother of the previous king, etc. something like that). She manipulates teh institution by killing all the male heirs to make it impossible to take over.<br/>3.  She does have some legitimacy. After all, she did rule for six years.<br/>4.  It's in Judah, NOT in Israel. Remember that.<br/>5.  Who do you think she wanted to follow her? It's not clear what would happen next, especially because she dismantled the entire system. The King died, she's not going to have another son.<br/>6.  Her authority is derived from being a mother (the mother of the previous king). There's the connection to Deborah.<br/>7.  The main threat to her authority comes from institutional religion. The priest of the temple puts him up and says that he is to be king now (the seven year old boy, find his name).<br/><br/>\\* It doesn't matter how close to the actual events these stories are, what's important is a tradition out of the kingom of Israel, whearas on the Judah side you see how centralized it is. *<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Fact 13: Traditional structures gave group authority to men, but powerful women could rise as mothers.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Monday, 10/30/17**  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Life Expectancy in Ancient Israel in Genesis 35.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Questions to think about: What do you learn from this about life and death? Anything? Is this the great threat for women? What would be a counterpart for men? Is there a great threat for men? What other threats to life can you think of?<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Genesis 35:<br/><br/>*   For Women: Childbirth because of lack of modern medicine basically.<br/>*   For Men: If there wasn't a violent threat, they could live a long time.<br/>*   Disease<br/><br/>**Evidence for the day**: Rachel story in Genesis 35<br/><br/>1.  In the larger narrative, Rachel waits years before this. So she's not young.  <br/>    <br/>2.  Every pregnancy was life or death. Not to say that the majority of them died in childbirth, but there was something to fear. Shows how scary life could be in that moment for both women and men.<br/>3.  Women did have help when it came to childbirth: the midwife, who was kind of a professional.<br/>4.  The name, Ben'ami, which shows how serious childbirth was taken. Does not gloss over the suffering of a woman.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Fact 14: Life could be cut off without warning, so it is better to see it as an obstacle course than as life spared. Their bodies were not intrinsicely different than ours, but would last if given a chance<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\* Think of the ancient people as more like us than we can imagine.

War was fought by legitimate authorities - mutually recognized kings.<br/>2.  Taking spoil was part of war, not seen as abuse. (if you win you get to take whatever's left basically)<br/>3.  Service was demanded by draft, also an intrusion. In a way it is kind of a violence: you are taking a young man out of his home and forcing him to fight<br/>4.  The killing was mainly confined to battle plus the males of defeated people.<br/><br/>\\* Genesis 34: After being introduced to Jacob and his sons. *<br/><br/>\\* Rape was considered an act of violence and the rapist would have to marry the victim in order to try and make ammends for the victim's entire family.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>HW: Defend one or the other statment based solely on the text translated on pg. 201 of Kathleen Abraham (the author NYU classes).

Marriage is the primary basis for connecting people not already related.<br/>2.  All marriage is inter-marriage and the only question is between whom.<br/>3.  Marriage does not make a woman property. Her family still maintains an interest in it.<br/>4.  Children are defined by this institution. So, all children are the product of marrying or merging with outsiders.

For the public, consumption of writing had to be out loud. It would tend to be at public places at public events.<br/>3.  It took money to pay for writing, so regardless of how wealthy someone was, writing was associated with institutions (eg. a palace). Unless the scribes themselves got involved.<br/>4.

Older, father, judge, seating? With no special tie to nature (not Sun, or Storm, or Healing, etc.). He is the father of the Gods.<br/>5.

How do you get your hands on hard currency? It doesn't happen.  <br/>\\* Shay's Rebellion, 1786-1787  <br/>\\* \\- Shays was being sued and so he got a bunch of people together to shut down the courts. None of the Rev.

By the end of that summer, they came out with a brand new thing that didn't resemble the Articles at all.  <br/>  <br/>Ratification:  <br/>  <br/>\\* Enough states had to vote in favor of the new document.

The latter meant JA and JQA. Think about Trump/Hilary today.  <br/>\\* Fierce Indian fighter/frontier settler made Jackson attractive to those who resented the East Coast's wealth and political power.  <br/>\\* Increased suffrage was radical.  <br/>\\* Dorr War in Rhode Island, 1842.  <br/>\\* (Thomas Wilson Dorr - couldn't vote cause he didn't own land, ran for some other political office, got votes illegally, went to jail).  <br/>\\* Support of statse over federal government.  <br/>\\* \\- As president, things were more complicated!  <br/>  <br/>\\* \\- **Nullification Crisis:** were federal laws superior to state laws? A bill \"nullified\" the ToAbom., but is that allowed?  <br/>  <br/>\\* \\- The Force BIll - The Federal Gov't could use force to enforce federal laws.  <br/>  <br/>\\* What to do about the BUS?  <br/>\\* Control credit, enforce connection between specie and printed money?  <br/>\\* Poor farmers and frontiersmen prefer state banks.  <br/>\\* Jackson starves the bank/bank calls in loans: known as the Bank War.

Industrial Revolution<br/>*   Trail of Tears/Indian Removal<br/>*   Era of Good Feelings/BUS/Henry Clay<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Timeline of Important Events from 1820-1858:<br/><br/>*   Missouri Compromise (1820): Missouri would be admitted as a slave state and Maine would be admitted as a free state. Also drew the 36-30 parallel to stop slavery above that line going westward... Later on, at what point was the Civil War inevitable?<br/>*   Election of Andrew Jackson (1828): Explotation of female slaves more than before. Election represents a cultural shift to an idea of masculinity of white plantation owners. Jackson was against a federal government. Wants to expand westward whether that meant getting rid of Indians, expanding slavery, etc.<br/>*   Indian Removal Act (1830): Conflict with Native Americans in Illinois. During Jackson's pres., his first major push toward Indian Removal.<br/>*   Black Hawk War (1832): \\*look this up later\\*<br/>*   Texas Revolution (1836): Texas was huge with cotton. Even if you weren't for-slavery you understood the economic importance of it. White plantation owners really want to keep slavery, some other people don't (don't remember who). Battle of the Alamo, fighting for rights.<br/>*   Panic of 1837 with the BUS (1837): A bubble in three markets: Cotton, Land, Slaves. Banks have been giving out loans that people couldn't pay back. The price of cotton drops, banks worry that plantation owners won't be able to pay off loans so they call in loans early. Everything starts failing, leads to financial panic (recession near depression). Affects North and South. People start to question to financial side of slavery.<br/>*   Greatest proportion of immigrant influx to the US (1845-1854):<br/>*   Annexation of Texas (1845):<br/>*   Mexican American War (1846):<br/>*   Compromise of 1850 (1850):<br/>*   Republican Party Founded (1854): First party to contest a party that has anti-slavery as it's national platform.<br/>*   Kansas Nebraska Act (1854): Territories that want to become states, instead of Missouri Compromise, the voters of the state will determine if they want slavery in their state or not. Basically cancels out the Missouri Compromise.<br/>*   Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857): Enslaved man was brought into a free territory does not become free even though he had lived there for a long time. Was slavery political or sexual. Decided that the rules of slavery apply everywhere and not just where slavery exists.<br/><br/>\\* Did slavery help the growth of capitalism?","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-KtmQ9nA6L_BTKZlYXhB","timestamp":1505158277481,"title":"Recitation US History"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"**Wednesday, 9/13/17**  <br/><br/>Virtual Machine:<br/><br/>*   Hardware/Software<br/>*   Operating Systems<br/>*   Applications (Process)<br/><br/>\\* Interace between hardware and sofware are instructions.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-Ktw42MZLQySlzEBdyGV","timestamp":1505320251996,"title":"Recitation Computer Systems Organization"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"**Paper 1:**  <br/><br/>**Cabeza de Vaca Reading Notes:**  <br/><br/>*   Governor Pánfilo de Narváez's expedition started on June 17th, 1527.

Notice how the author refers to him as a protagonist int he beginning of this story. - pg. 48<br/>*   \"Cabeza de Vaca was a man of slender physique in his mid-thirties. He hailed from Jerez de la Frontera, a parched but attractive Andalusian town about 50 miles due south of Seville.\" - pg.48<br/>*   CabDev was the oldest boy of his five siblings. At the age of 18 he became an orphan after his parents passed away and he had to care for his siblings... He got military experience - pg.49<br/>*   It's likely that Narv. didn't have much of a say in CabDev joining the expedition - pg. 50<br/>*   \"Captain Andrès Dorantes and Alonso del Castillo were nearly as prominent as Cabez de Vaca.\" - pg.50<br/>*   Women were included in the Florida expedition. There were ten women on this voyage and they were all married and traveling with their husbands. - pg.54<br/>*   \"\\[Estebanico\\] was a vivacious, outgoing, and curious young man with a remarkable facility for languages.\" - pg. 56<br/>*   Overcrowding was an issue on the voyage. It seems like the sea journey was pretty bad, with rotten food, lack of fresh water, lots of sharing having to be done and with their hands, etc. - pg. 60<br/>*   They found themselves in a hurricane. This caused them to postpone the departure date because they had to replace lost ships.<br/>*   So far, much more detailed about time than CabDev's account.<br/><br/>Chapter 4<br/><br/>*   \"During this time, the rift between Narv. and CabDe. deepened. The Royal Treasurer had wanted from the outset to remain close to the coast and reestablish contaact with the ships as soon as possible. Yielding to the majority, he had been forced to march inland. After two weeks of arduous marches, CabDev. had become ever-more convinced that his plan was the right one.\" - pg.93<br/>*   At first Narv. did not want to hear anything about going to the coast because it was too far. He eventually sent CabDev to lead 40 men to the coast.<br/>*   CabDev.'s plan failed so they went with Narv.'s plan<br/>*   Apalachee was the largest and most complex cheifdom of the Florida peninsula.<br/>*   \"Narv. ordered CabDev. to take nine cavalrymen and fifty foot soldiers and attack the village.\" - pg.100<br/>*   \"Apalachee was hardly the \"sparsely populated\" land described by the hostages\" - pg.102<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Chapter 4 of CabDev:<br/><br/>    \\- It seems like CabDev was just very sure of himself here. I don't think there was any sort of argument or conflict, necessarily. It was more like just a frustrating situation where CabDev really believed he was right and if not understand Narv.'s decision. IMO CabDev was right - they were ill equipped to (land/stay/dock/go)? and so it would be better to (do the opposite of that?).  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Chapter 10 of CabDev:<br/><br/>    \\- I can tell now that CabDev is getting annoyed with Narv. because he keeps wanting to do the opposite of what he says. I still don't think there is any strong hate, though, based on CabDev's account. It is more like a lot of frustration like \"why don't you listen to me? Why do you always want to do the opposite of what I say\"  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Chapter 5 ALSS<br/><br/>    \\- After a Greek man and a slave were captured by the Indians, Narv. basically told everyone to fend for themselves because it was time for everybody to do what they thought was best to survive. The people on Narv's ships were about to die of starvation and could not row out to sea, which is what CabDev. wanted. He was sailing to a third ship that was drifiting out to sea. - pg. 127<br/><br/>    \\- Narv. was pretty selfish. He got to sleep in a raft while the others slept on the shore in the way of a possible Indian attack - pg. 131  <br/><br/>\\*\\* For a couple of chapters there really isn't much about the relationship between CabDev. and Narv.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\- A lot of it is about CabDev. acting as the medicine man through religion. - Chapter 8- 9<br/><br/>\\- Wait a minute!

Using DuVal's Independence Lost and the negotiations among the British, the Choctaw, and the Chickasaw (including Payamataha) in 1765, write a paper addressing the following questions: **Why was Payamataha successful in his pursiut of peace? Why was this peace threatened after his death?**_<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Independence Lost:**  <br/><br/>*   Payamataha and his people did not want to fight in the revolution. They wanted peace.<br/>*   Payamataha had the leading role among the Chickasaws. - loc. 397<br/>*   Decades before Paya. was born, in the mid-1720s, the British and the Chickasaws fought TOGETHER against the French and other Indian enemies. Now the topic of the essay makes sense, the Chickasaws have a long history with the British and want to keep peace with them and enemies with the French. It is this long history that made the British hope that Paya.'s people would assist them again in the war against the rebels (the colonists) and anyone else who joined their side. - loc.397<br/>*   Payamataha's story is different because he and his people did not want to fight on the either side of the war (not helping the British). They wanted to maintain peace. - loc. 404<br/>*   Being a warrior was the standard path to leadership for Chickasaws.<br/>*   Paya. depended on persuasion and goods distribution for his influence. - loc. 410<br/>*   The Chickasaws had slaves that they captured in battle. But the children of their slaves were often not slaves themselves. Some could even move up in rank or be free of slavery. Apparently, southern plantation slavery was an anomaly in the history of the Americans, Europe, Africa, and Asia slavery. - Chp.2 loc. 410<br/>*   \"Payamataha still followed his ancestors’ assumptions that the world was divided not into a few “races” but into thousands of different peoples—the big divide was between Chickasaws and all non-Chickasaws, not between Indians and non-Indians.\" - DuVal, Kathleen. Independence Lost: Lives on the Edge of the American Revolution (Kindle Locations 525-527). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.  <br/>    <br/>*   Chickasaws were known as the most ferocious group of Native Americans, and had very good stirke-retreat strategies to maintain their population.<br/>*   \"Neighbors called them 'the most military people of any about the great river,' meaning the Mississippi.\" - loc. 424<br/>*   Starting in 1729, the Chickasaws got into a lot of wars with the French. This made their alliance with the British even stronger.<br/>*   Wars with the French, including disease, decreased security for the Chickasaws, and caused many of them to move to fortified towns on a ridge overlooking the region. Many of them were persuaded to leave Chickasaw country and live as refugees. - loc. 431<br/>*   By the Seven Years' War, there were only about 1600 Chickasaws living in Chickasaw country. They lived in a town called Big Town - loc. 431-438<br/>*   Payamataha means \"war leader\" or \"war prophet.\" He grew up in these fortified Chickasaw towns during the time in which war was escalating quickly. - loc. 438<br/>*   As a child, Paya never showed signs of being a peacemaker. He was a natural born warrior, killing over 40 men on his own, hunting, gathering war titles, etc. - loc. 445<br/>*   In an encounter with the Creeks, Paya. had to defend the British even though the Creeks said they encroached on their territory more than the French did. He referenecd the civil war of the Choctaws as proof that the French can turn the Native Americans against each other. - loc. 464<br/>*   \"The Chickasaws 'would not be idle lookers on; the cause of the English should be theirs, in opposition to French, Cherokee, and all other enemies,' which could certainly include Creeks.\" - loc. 471<br/>*   By the time the French had left North America, ending the Seven Years' War, Paya. had become the headman in charge of war and diplomacy.<br/>*   Despite being a warrior in the past and holding the office of \"head leading warrior\" Paya. did not \"turn warrior\" like some of the other peace chiefs at the time. He decided to end Chickasaw warring. That was the only way to save the population - loc. 485<br/>*   Paya wanted to turn warpaths back into trade routes. He met with other choctaw leaders to discuss ending their decades of war. They signed a peace treaty in May 1759, one of the most successful peace treaties in history. Decades of war became permanent peace. - loc. 491-498<br/>*   Paya. made peace with a lot of old enemeis: Choctaws in the south, Cherokees and Catawbas in the east, Creeks in the southeast, and Quapaws in the west.<br/>*   \"Had most women opposed his peacemaking efforts, he would have failed.\" - loc. 498<br/>*   \"Payamataha's power came in part from the spiritual world, and his exhortation to make peace was based on a spiritual calling to avoid war.\" - loc. 506.<br/>*   \"Payamataha agreed with Nativists that Indians should not fight one another, but jhe disagreed that the solution was to fight Europeans. Payamatatha's movement focused on getting along with everyone no matter their history.\" - loc. 520<br/>*   Payamataha saw himself as almost like the white people, because white was the color of peace for southeeastern Indians (due to the lack of red, for blood). He thought this way because of all the connections and benefits he gained from the British. - loc. 535<br/>*   Paya. defied what the British wanted (to basically only be allied to them) and allied with Spanish Louisiana. This is because Paya. did not want to make any other European enemies.<br/>*   Paya. brokered peace between the Choctaws and the British.<br/>*   \"In 1772, Nativist messages circulated through the south, urging that if 'the English, France, and Spain are at war\\[,\\] all the red people is to be at peace.'\" - loc. 571<br/>*   For two decades, Paya. worked with other Chickasaw leaders to help change their place in the world form warriors to peace.<br/>*   After his death, the Chickasaw leaders found it difficult to remain independent while other confederacies grew around them and tried to combine to increase their power. - loc. 5104<br/>*   Alexander McGillivray's plan for the Chickasaws to join a Southern Confederacy that would combine with a Northern Confederacy to basically fend off \"illegal immigrants.\" This would threaten Chickasaw independent foreign policy making and possibly pull them back into war - loc. 5115<br/>*   McGillivray wanted the southereastern Indians to surrender some of their independence to be allied against the Americans.<br/>*   Conflict increased between the Creeks and the Chickasaws. The Creeks wanted to assassinate Piomingo and other Chickasaw leaders for exercising their own nation's independent foreign policy. Paya.'s policy of peace with everyone was no longer possible. - loc. 5383<br/><br/>**Payamataha Primary Source**  <br/><br/>*   Payamataha is part of some kind of gathering of leaders.<br/>*   It is a meeting to settle for peace and alliance between the Americans or British and the Natives. That's why Paya. is there. It's a meeting that took place over several days. - pg. 216<br/>*   There is a religious component here, that God gave them the victory and that now they are to make peace. - pg.224<br/>*   According to Paya., a white man settled outside of the Chickasaw village and ruined their crops?. They wanted to make sure that this would not happen again. - pg. 224<br/>*   The symbol of a \"white wing\" or just something white in general shows up on page 225. When the Natives hold it, they do not let anything bad come from their mouths. - pg. 225<br/>*   Religion continues to play a role in the attempt for peace.<br/>*   King George is like a protector of the Natives? - pg. 228<br/>*   I think it is talking about King George and his power of the Natives/Colonists.<br/>*   The Chickasaws and Choctaws should live together in harmony under one father, the Great King. - pg. 235<br/>*   \"That past offences be forgot & Buried in Oblivion, that no other Emulation or Strife do Exist in your Nations, But who shall be most Dutyfull to His Father & most Affectionate to His White & Red Brethren.\" - pg. 235<br/>*     <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Thesis Ideas:**<br/><br/>*   It's possible that Paya.'s history as a warrior is what allowed him to understand that peace is a better option than fighting.<br/>*   His peaceful efforts were successful because he was determined to keep his people safe by avoiding war. He also gained a lot of his respect and power from persuasion and goods distrubition, which must have helped him underestand the idea of compromise in negotiations.<br/>*   It seems more like a matter of just trying in the first place to have peace with other nations. Before, Chickasaws were seen as the most military people of the southeastern Indians, and becacuase of Paya.'s level of respect among his people as a leader, he got to set the tone for the entire commmunity. Imagine the coolest kid in school who gets to decide what is cool for everyone, basically like that.<br/>*   This peace was threatened after his death because he was no longer there to enforce the peace. Now you want to think of it as someone who starts a legacy somewhere and then has to pass it on to someone else; there is always the possibility that it will not be as good because the original person's vision is not there anymore, not matter how hard the next person tries.<br/>*   Unfortunately, because Paya. was not there anymore, the new people in charge did not know how he would have reacted to certain situations, ultimately causing them to fall back into trouble when they could not make the right decision for peace or war. This then followed a spiral effect until things just got out of hand.<br/><br/>Organizing Paper:<br/><br/>1.  Intro ( ~ 1 page )<br/>2.

It is mentioned in the first line but that's it. Then it talks about other women falling in love with David, but never really anything about him loving them back.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>1 Samuel 20:<br/><br/>*   Saul wants/tries to kill David.

David says he loved Jonathan very much, like a brother, which shows how close they were. But the fact that he also says that it is more than his love of women makes it seem like he doesn't understand why he loves him more than women, he just knows that he enjoys Jonathan's company and would rather spend time with thim than any woman.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Gilgamesh Penn I:<br/><br/>*   \"As for the axe, its form was strange.\" - line 31.

By the counsel of the god it was declared, and at the cutting of his navel-cord, she was designated for him.\" - Col. IV lines 159-163. It says a few lines before that the family net is open for the one who chooses. Maybe this means that the person getting married has the right to marry anybody they want? If so, then maybe the line about the navel-cord references his birth and how he may have been born homosexual but wasn't really aware of it.<br/>*   \"At the words of the young man, his \\[Enkidu's\\] face turned pale.\" - line Col.

Think about what the words mean metaphorically and how they describe a sexual scene. What abouts what they're saying helps you define an image of love.<br/>3.  **(1 Pages) Section 2**, Read 1 Samuel 18-20 and then the entire Gilgamesh Penn tablet.

They have a very specific political viewpoint, which is why we can't take it as completly right. Put the Bible at the table, but there are many different viewpoints that we are not getting because this was written so specifically.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Sennacherib's Annals**: Senn. is the king of Assyria. It provides a very different view of the (something?). You can find this in 2 Kings 18-19.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Tanakh: Torah (Teaching/Law; the authoritative part of the Jewish religion.)<br/><br/>Prophets: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings explicity tied to Israel's narrative).

He missed that the tabinaeu had different meanings based on context. The first is in a family setting, the second is (look it up in notes). He understood the difference in context in his second description.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>First: Tabniau was a patrilocal (defined by a father) extended family (out of the nuclear family) and a patri-lineage (lineage by the father). It was a corporate, land-holding unit (there were plots of land called binau and they were hed/owned by bodies that were defined by the tabinau: gardening plots, routes could all be applied).<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Second: The tabinau has different meanings in different contexts; In one context it is a house or a dwelling: Person(s) related to the speaker through ties of land (if you share tabinau land (garden:))<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Prayer to the Gods of the Night**<br/><br/>**Psalm 82:** In the Bible; has the mention of Elohim (El = god, Elohim = gods).<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\* To make foreign means to decontextualize.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\-\\-\\-\\- Class 5: Defining History ----  <br/><br/>Fact: Your history is your life and so was theirs.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**_\\*Very Important for this Fact\\*_**  <br/><br/>**Geoff Eley**: Defines social history.<br/><br/>**Social History**: Enough attention to kings and power.

Why would they tell the story from someone who wasn't a king?<br/><br/>\\* The term \"myth\" is important. We talked about fallacy of origins. Do not take them as history.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\-\\-\\-\\- Class 8: The Roel of Archaeology ----  <br/><br/>Fact: Archaeology gives reality without spin -- until historians get to it.<br/><br/>This fact is pretty self explanatory... It is about how historians have to make a decision about things they find.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Willian Dever and Avraham Faust**: Both want to look at archaeology without using the Bible. They are minimalist. This is as opposed to a maximalist, who would who the Bible extensively to find meaning in arcaheology.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Izbet Sartah:** The houses that formed the elliptical. Israel Finkelstein is the one who excavated this site. It may reflect mobile people who were settling before moving again. Fink. argues that just because it was setup in a tent structure does not mean that that is how they lived.

Doesn't mention Israel, but does say Yahweh because Israel is the people of Yahweh. Dates back to around 600 BCE.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Song of Deborah** \\- Deborah gained power divinely; the Lord spoke directly to her. Deborah is a female leader in antiquity, a prophet and had the role of deciding disputes. Her authority is rooted in perceived access to divine power. Her husband is Lappidoth, although he has no real role in the story. She is \"a mother of Israel\" but not a mother in the sense that we know it. A leader before kings.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Nevi'im** \\- The second part of the Hebrew Bible, the name meaning \"Prophets.\" It is all stories about the prophets and contains the book of Judges, book of Joshua, etc...<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Mesha Inscription** \\- Carved on a black basalt stone measuring 1.15m high. It was discovered by Alsatian missionary Frederik Klein at Dihban in 1868. The inscription has broken down over time and because of the amount of interest in it; the ending is missing, but 2/3 were able to be pieced together. It was written in Moabite and dates back to around 835 BCE. Mesha is the son of Kemosh, and he followed in his father's footsteps by being a ruthless ruler. He was known for tearing things down and destorying places and their people. Came after the division of Israel into the Northern and Southern kingdoms. Look to Joshua 8 for evidence, as we are dealing with people/kingdom with one particular God who organizes their warfare. Herem is utter destruction on behalf of a God, which is celebrated in this text (obedience for divenly inspired acts). Victory followed sacrifice. Has no relation to the Bible.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Emar** \\- Dates back to 13th century BCE Syria. \"Emar\" is a site on the map, close to modern day Syria. The story of Hayabeginsmakes and his daughter, Dada, whom he made both mother and father of the household. Inheritance by a prostitute<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Schneider's \"second description\"** \\- The term \"tabinau\" has different meanings based on the context.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Samaria** \\- The capital of Israel, as defined in the Merenptah Stele.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**586 BCE** \\- Babylon destroyed the Kindom of Judah. Babylonians exiled the people of Judah. No longer independent people living in this land.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Judah** \\- The centralized, capital of Jerusalem. The king is always the son of the previous king, and you can constrast this to the Northern Kingdom of Isreal, where the royal family can change because the king is chosen by the people.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Moses** \\- Leads the Israelites out of Egypt. Story of Exodus.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Rehoboam** \\- The son of Solomon. When asked by the people if he could lighten up on them he asked the advice of his elders and of his peers. He ended up going with his peers, telling the people that he would be even tougher on them than his father was. Evidence comes from 1 Kings 12. Remember that this is Israel, not Judah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Genesis** \\- Story of the creation of the world. Ends with Moses and the story of Exodus.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**el-Amarna** \\- The Amarna Letters, which were correspondences between Egypt nad Canaan. If there was a such thing as \"Israel,\" it would have been written about in these letters. They were written in Akkadian in the 1350s BCE, which is BEFORE Meremphta and close to Exodus. It doesn't mention anything about Israel.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Four Room House** \\- Weaving and how it allowed women to sell things outside hte home. We made this connection because we're using the Biblical texts (if the men are not there, they are out in battle, then the women must be at home weaving). Making an assumption that women will be in homes.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Esther** -<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Tel Dan Inscription** \\- First widely accepted reference to the name David as the founder of a Judahite polity outside of the Hebrew Bible. One of four contemporary steles that mentions Israel. Tells about Hazaal, ruler of Aram, and his victories over Omri and his ally, the king of the House of David.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Jezreel Valley** \\- Large expanse of fertile land and valley near the Galilee region where many Israelite battles were fought.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Isaiah** \\- Prophet who wrote the book of Isaiah. This book details how other Gods are just defined as other than Yahweh?<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Yahweh** \\- The name of the Israelite dieity, the national God of the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Tanakh** \\- Name of the Hebrew Bible.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ketuvim** \\- The third part of the Hebrew Bible, the name meaning \"Writings.\" It contains the books Psalms, Proverbs, The Scrolls, Daniel, etc..<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Moab** \\- City that was destroyed by King Mesha? (Re-read Mesha Inscription)<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Assyria** \\- Known as a land of very strong, violent people. King was Sennacherib, who attacked and captured all the people and cities of Judah. This was apparently done as a divine act. Sennacherib was punished for disrespecting the God of Israel by having 185k of his soldiers killed during the night before he planned a seige on Jerusalem.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Tabinau of the Yap people** \\- A patrilocal (defined by a father) extended family and a patrilineage (lineage by the father). Two different descriptions given by David Schneider. The first is defined as a patrillocal extended family, a patrilineage is defined by a father. Everything goes through the father, as he is the head of the household. Also is a corporate (meaning communal) landholding unit. There were plots of land called binau that were owned as bodies that were defined by tabinau. The second definition is that taibnau has different meanings depending on the context.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Jerusalem** \\- Sacred Kingdom of Jerusalem. Existed before Israel, we know this because from the 14th century we have letters from Jerusalem but not Israel. Archaeologists are not allowed to excavate it even though that is where we would find Solomon's Temple and the Royal Palace. We know these are there from descriptions in the Bible. A major city in the 8th century. It is \"David's City\" and we only know as much as the people tell us. It is the capital of Judah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Iron Age** \\- 1200 BCE and ends in 586 BCE. Time period when most of the events of ancient Israel take place.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Abraham** \\- First person God spoke to. Was about to sacrifice his son, Jacob to please God, but when God saw this he decided not to take Jacob.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Joshua** \\- From the Book of Joshua, we found out that Joshua was also capable of destroying entire civilizations, similar to Mesha. In Joshua 8, he is told by the Lord to attack Ai, and he did not hesitate to take an army and complete the task. By the end of the story, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the laws of Moses and read it aloud, word for word.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Izbet Sartah** \\- Dates back to the 12th century (1110s), and comes AFTER Merenphtah. It comes BEFORE the book of Kings and would be a part of the book of Judges (there are leaders before kings). Little rooms surrounding an elliptical shaped area. Sheep and other animals were kept along the outisde of the circle. Followed an egalitarian setup, meaning there was no social hierarchy. All houses were just about the same size. There is no writing found, and for this reason we cannot associate the people who lived there to a specific group. They may have reflected Israeli people and people who were very mobile, but we are not sure. The site was very small, as was the population.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**\"Social History\"** \\- Not looking at history through the kings and queens and other royal people. To get a true sense of the times we must look at history through the eyes of the common people, the everyday people. This is what George Eley asserted. He became a historian in order to impact how people look at the past, especially the poor.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Theophoric personal name** \\- A name that carries/embeds that name of a God, such as Daniel, Jonathan, Nathaniel, Samuel, etc.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Little Israel** \\- The little expanse of land between the Dead Sea and somewhere up higher. It is the original, small settlement of Isreal before David and Solomon's expansion . Imagined image of Israel is the larger one with all the different tribes together, making the Bible a more powerful text. The name Israel has a geography, but there is not a very specific definition of Israel geographically. For example, Merenphta refers to Israel as a people rather than a location.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Damascus** \\- Capital of Syria. Major city in the in the Aram-Damascus empire that fights against Israel.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Saul** \\- The first ruler of united Israel (both Noth and South) in the Book of Kings. He is the father of Jonathan, and David's son was Solomon. Tried to kill David (think about the Gilgamesh paper). When he was killed (think around the time of the Gilgamesh paper you wrote) his son, David, took over. David's son is Solomon, who was a very tough ruling king, and _his_ son, Rehoboam, tells the people of Israel that he will be even tougher than his father.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Merenptah Stele** \\- The first reference to Israel in the Bible, coming in 1207 BCE. Because of this we know that Israel existed at this time. Egyptian tablet talking about the people Merenptah conquered in 1207 BCE. The Egyptians were controlling Canaan at the time.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Torah** \\- The first five books of the Hebrew Bible, and is also known as Pentateuch. The name Torah means \"Teachings.\" Book of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Jezebel** \\- The daughter of Sidon. Also married to Ahab. Apparently does a lot of bad things like getting the people of Israel to worship Ba'al.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Akhenaten** \\- The Sun God. Ruled over Akhetaten. Changes the city of Akhetaten to modern day El-Amarna.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Babylon** -<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Aram** \\- Aramaean state near Damascus i nthe 12th century. An important Aramaean stele is the Tel Dan Inscription.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**722/720 BCE** \\- Marks the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem (North) by the Assyrians. The Assyrian Empire moves into the North and dismantles the Kingdom of Israel, leaving only the Southern Kingdom (Judah). This is told about in the 1st and 2nd Book of Kings.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**House of David** \\- AKA the Kingdom of Judah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Jacob** \\- Also known as \"Israel.\" The 12 tribes of Israel are his sons. When people hear the name Jacob they realize they have a common ancestor.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Solomon** \\- The son of David. Known for being very tough on his people. His son is Rehoboam.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Exodus** \\- Ancient Egypt. Israelites are told to kill the first born son of every Jewish person, so one mom lets her son go in a basket in the river; this is Moses. He is adopted into a family and his adoptive brother becomes Pharoh. When Moses sees the Israelites being poorly treated by the Egyptians he asks the Pharoh to free them but he denies. Then God killed the Pharoh's first born son and he was really upset about this. In his rage he allowed the Israelites to go free, but when he called down he told his army to get them back. This is when Moses split the Red Sea (covered in blood because of God's disapproval of the poor treatment of the Israelites). Moses then closed the Sea on the army that was folllowing them and they made it to Israel, but Moses was not allowed in because he reacted angrily to something that God decided to do.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Canaan** \\- The land given to Abraham by God.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Shechem** -<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Athaliah** \\- Mother of the king. She is NOT from the House of David, but she was still in the royal family. Killed all male heirs to the throne so that she could rise to power. She actually ruled and had a lasting effect (six year rule). What it took to overthrow her was a plausible return to the royal family, in which (find name later) was hidden away in a temple so that he could overthrow her; this happened when he was 7 years old. Her story, 2 Kings 11, is a negative one. Athaliah has no divine power, it is purely institutional.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Shalmaneser III** \\- King of Assyria who led a successful compaign against the kingdom of Israel in the 800s BCE. He is the one who was king when Assyria destroyed the kingdom of Israel in 720 BCE.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Omri** \\- King of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. He is important because he became king not because of his bloodline but because the people elected him in. He was some kind of military commander. Remember, this is Israel (North), anybody can become king because it is not based on lineage. Evidence for this comes in 1 Kings 16:15-20.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**City of David** \\- (Core of the settlement) Jerusalem.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Michal** -","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-KwuMavgplDMXcJFyKLC","timestamp":1508512787847,"title":"CnC: Midterm Review"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"**Paper Info:**  <br/>  <br/>**Lecture:** 3  <br/>  <br/>**Fact**: Israel was another not so splashy, Middle Eastern people, unique like you are to your mother.  <br/>  <br/>**Primary Evidence**: Mesha Stele  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence:**  <br/>  <br/>\\- \"Analyzing the Abominable: Our Understanding of Canaanite Religion\" by Delbert Hillers  <br/>  <br/>\\- \"The Early History of God\" by Mark S. Smith  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Steps:**  <br/>  <br/>1\\. Read primary evidence  <br/>2\\. Read secondary evidence  <br/>3\\. Write paper  <br/>  <br/>**In Reading the Primary Source**:  <br/>  <br/>1\\. What is it that you want to understand about the evidence? For the warrior-bond topic, I issued a challenge; this time you must choose your own. You cannot simply describe the evidence as if that mattered in itself. Why is the evidence significant for understanding ancient Israel or the world in which it was embedded? There is no single answer. You must decide what interests you and define a research problem in light of it. This objective will be addressed in sections, and your teaching assistant and I are available for consultation.  <br/>  <br/>2\\. Even as you will have a specific angle of pursuit, you need to understand your evidence completely in order to evaluate properly that specific question in light of the material’s full character. For Jonathan and David, that meant working through all of the textual content relevant to defining the relationship between them. Work systematically.  <br/>3\\. With your specific question in mind, make detailed observations, looking for features that could illuminate the issue of concern. Watch especially for surprises, aspects that you did not notice at first. Don’t worry about what others have noticed or what they think; what are you learning that you would not have thought until this moment?  <br/>  <br/>4\\. Working from your specific research interest, yet still before trying to read outside interpretations and without yet meaning to write your paper, come up with a draft hypothesis, what the evidence suggests to you based only on your own observations. This means answering your own question from the available evidence. Propose your own interpretation, specifying the exact evidence relevant to the question and developing a rigorous line of reasoning to support your interpretation.  <br/>  <br/>**In Reading the Secondary Source:**  <br/>  <br/>1\\. Have they already discovered your most important observations? If so, do they see them exactly as you have? Do they apply them likewise or differently?  <br/>2\\. What are the research questions that drive their projects and how do these align with or differ from yours? What are the implicatiosn of these alignments and divergences? Look for where their work can help you toward your own destination. Never let them set the agenda, even as they may transform the way you approach your own.  <br/>3\\. Where do they disagree with you? So far as this is true, is it based on something they know that you did not, and you have to shift direction? Believe it or not, even as a non-expert, you have the same core evidence, and you may have an argument to prove them wrong. Stick to your guns, if you can see this! Somethimes they are simply approaching a problem with something different in mind, and you still have a way forward.  <br/>4\\. Even where their interests may head in a direction different from yours, do they provide you information that can advance your own progress? Some readings can offer very targeted help.  <br/>5\\. NOTE: I propose that you should aim to have cited roughly FIVE sources of specialist study. Not all topics will lend themselves to this. More sources can be one way of showing depth and effort. In the end, however, your papers will show their quality by the effort and thought put into the analysis of primary evidence, and that analysis will be the principal bassi for our evaluation.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Background:**  <br/>  <br/>**Important to Remember:**  <br/>  <br/>\\* This topic has to do with the differences and similarities between **Borrowing** and **Sharing**  <br/>\\* It is about the question of uniqueness.  <br/>\\* Remember that it relates to Joshua 8.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Primary Evidence 1: Mesha Stele**  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Similarities between Mesha Inscription and Joshua 8 (from professor):  <br/>  <br/>1\\. We are dealing w/ a people or kingdom and a God who organizes their work there.  <br/>2\\. Both texts celebrate victory by a sequence of divinely inspired acts. Battles initiated by the God  <br/>3\\. Obedient execution leads to success. Not fear, just obedience. Doing what the Gods tell you.  <br/>4\\. Victory means slaughter, especially by inhabitants of a city.  <br/>5\\. Herem. The same rare word for divinely \\*attack?\\* is slaughter.  <br/>6\\. Sacrifice post-victory  <br/>7\\. Victory followed by building, especially a shrine for the people's God. (Destruction then  <br/>  <br/>_**Mesha Inscription:**_  <br/>  <br/>\\* The inscription was carved on a black basalt stone measuring 1.15m high and 60-68cm wide. It was discovered by Alsatian missionary Klein at Dihban in 1868.  <br/>\\* The original stone was demolished because there was a lot of interest in it by the Europeans in Palestine. The pieces were made into amulets.  <br/>\\* The end of the inscription is completely lost, while 2/3 of it were able to be pieced together in the Louvre museum.  <br/>\\* The text on the inscription was written in Moabite (roughly Israelite Hebrew) and dates back to around 835 BCE. It belongs to the genre of building inscirptions.  <br/>\\* Mesha is the son of Kemosh.., and is the king of Moab, the Dibonite. He took over after his father's rein of 30 years.  <br/>\\* Mesha looked down on all of his enemies and was deliered from all kings.  <br/>\\* Omri was the king of Israel and he oppressed Moab for many days, according to the text. Kemosh was angry with his land and when his son, Mesha succeeded him, he said that he, too, will oppress Moab.  <br/>\\* Mesha, in the land of Medeba, built Baal Meon, a water reservoir, and built Kiriathaim.  <br/>\\* Mesha fought against the people of the city of Ataroth, and won, killing all their poeple as sacrifice for Kemosh and for Moab.  <br/>\\* Mesha also attacked and killed the population on Nebo.  <br/>\\* \"I have built Karchoh, the wall of the woods and the wall of the citadel, and I have built its gates, and I have built its towers, and I have built the house of the king, and I have made teh double reservoir for the spring in the innremost part of the city.\" - Mesha Inscription, Mesha's Building Activites at Karchoh.  <br/>\\* Mesha talks a lot about how he built things, but then in a lot of places he talks about how he destroyed things and killed the people there.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Primary Evidence 2: Joshua 8**  <br/>  <br/>**_Joshua 8_**  <br/>  <br/>\\* \"Then the Lord said to Joshua, 'Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai.'\" - Joshua 8.1  <br/>\\* It seems that Joshua already did the same thing to Jericho and its King, but this time he should take its plunder and livestock for himself.  <br/>\\* Joshua sent his army of 30k soldiers to attack Ai. Then told them to set fire to it at the end.  <br/>\\* Joshua did not draw back the hand that held the javelin until all the people of Ai had been killed and the city burned down.  <br/>\\* Joshua then built an altar to the Lord on Mount Ebal, as he was instructed by Moses.  <br/>\\* Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses. He then read all the words of the law - the blessings and the curses - just as they were written in the Book of the Law.  <br/>  <br/>\\* In Joshua 8, we also see the idea of a higher power influencing a human just like in the Mesha Stele. Joshua just did what the Lord told him to do without question.  <br/>  <br/>\\* There are layers (kind of) (from highest to lowest): Powerful Deities/El/Yahweh - Other Deities/Kemosh/Asherah - Humans  <br/>  <br/>\\* Here is sort of different than the Mesha Stele because it is the Lord, not some other deity, speaking to Joshua so there is that direct connection as opposed to in Mesha where it is (based on our other knowledeg) a second-tier deity, if you will.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence 1: AA by Dilbert Hillers**  <br/>  <br/>**Notes for the Hiller Text:**  <br/>  <br/>\\* Canaanites were polytheistic. Think about this in terms of King Mesha and how he was almost \"spoken to\" by his late father. They have multiple Gods who they pray to.  <br/>\\* \\- Also refer to Joshua 8 where Joshua is spoken to directly to invade that city.  <br/>  <br/>\\* \"Those names of deities which have a plain sense, such as Baal (\"Lord\") and Mot (\"Death\"), show thaat the Canaanite religion was \"in this respect, at least, more primitive and nearer its fountainhead than the others.\"\" - pg. 260  <br/>\\* Canaanite is being characterized as \"primitive\" by someone named Albright and Hillers is trying to prove that wrong. - pg. 260  <br/>\\* Determining what is primitive is a matter of perspective, according to Hillers. - pg. 260  <br/>\\* **\\* There are many important figures in the Canaanite religion *** \\- pg. 261  <br/>\\* \"In dealing with paganism, Kaufmann does not offer the sort of catalogue of deities which scholars have frequently prepared, but attempts to locate a fundemental, underlying idea. This turns out to be \"the idea that there exists a realm of being prior to the gods and above them, upon which the gods depend, and whose decrees they must obey.\"\" - pg. 261  <br/>\\* \"The deities of Ras Shamra are a community of husbands and wives, fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, who contend with each other, build each other houses, sacrifice, make banquets, and so forth.\" - pg. 261  <br/>\\* \"From this view of the gods \\[^ the one above\\] as dependent on what lies outside them, as originating in a separate world-stuff, come conceptions of the possibility of mixing the divine with the human and a ready theory of magic, which is an invocation of 'self-operating forces taht are independent of the gods.'\" - pg. 262. **This idea makes sense in terms of the Mesha Inscription.**  <br/>\\* \"\"The pagan conceives of the gods as powers embodied in nature,\" we read, but is this true of El, for example, a principal deity?... he is paternal, aged, wise, just, and compassionate - a picture more obviously related to roels in human society than to 'nature.'\" - pg. 263  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence 2: TEHOG by Mark Smith.**  <br/>  <br/>**Notes for the Smith text:**  <br/>  <br/>\\* The Ugaritic tablets discovered in 1929 at Ras Shamra on the coast of Syria date back to the second half of the second millennium B.C.. These tablets have provided a lot of insight into the religion of the Canaanites. - pg. 2  <br/>\\* The Canaanites were the neighbors of the Israelites. These Ugaritic texts help to shine light on the relationship between these two groups. - pg. 2  <br/>\\* There was the idea that because deities like El, Asherah, Baal, Anat, and Omri (I think?) were Canaanite they could not be Israelite. \"According to this view, Israel had always been essentially monolatrous; Israel worshipped only Yahweh, although it did not deny the existence of other deities. While Israel could tolerate other peoples' worship of their deities, Yahweh was ultimately the most powerful deity in the cosmos.\" - pg. 2  <br/>\\* **Monolatry**: The worship of one God without the denial of the existence of others.  <br/>\\* \"Accordingly, Exodus 15:11 asks, 'Who is like you among the gos, O Yahweh?' It was Israel's monolatry that led to the monotheism just before and during the Exile (587-539), when Israel explicitly denied the power of all other deities. Whatever influence other deities manifested in ancient, monolatrous Israel, scholars often considered them syncretistic, peripheral, ephemeral, or part of Israel's 'popular religion' and not its 'official religion'.\" - pg. 3  <br/>\\* \\*\\* Page 3 is important.  <br/>\\* The other deities besides El were not really worshipped much, if at all. It was really just El who was the most powerful. - pg. 4  <br/>\\* The names of deities has little to do with people's devotion to them - pg. 5  <br/>\\* **Convergence**: The coalescence of various deities and/or some of their features into the figure of Yahweh. Basically, all the aforementioned deities were basically just parts of Yahweh/El.  <br/>\\* **Differentiation**: Of Israelite cult from its \"Canaanite\" heritage. This process began with the rejection of Baal worship in the 9th century.  <br/>\\* Monotheism was a product of the Israelites' exile from Egypt. - pg. 11  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence 3:**  <br/>  <br/>Notes for ...  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence 4:**  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>What is your topic: The Mesha Inscription and the question of uniqueness.  <br/>  <br/>Possible Research Questions/Argument:  <br/>  <br/>1\\. Is it requried that the male heir to a throne continue his father's legacy?  <br/>  <br/>2\\. **Based on the primary evidence given to us in the Meshs Inscription, we find the in Ancient Israel many actions were carried out to please a higher power. In the Mesha Inscription, we find King Mesha conquering groups of people in order to continue/avenge his father's work.**  <br/>3\\. - This is probably because being spoken to directly by a spirit or God is a very special event. Basically, if a God tells you to do something, you do it. It seems that this was the mindset for Joshua in Joshua 8 and now here where King Mesha is building and destroying in the name of his father.  <br/>  <br/>4\\. - The divine is the most important aspect in being a ruler in antiquity. The greatest and most legitimate power comes from God.  <br/>  <br/>5\\. Can we argue that the ancient Canaanites/Israelites were polytheistic or that they were monotheistic but could still pray to other Gods, such as in the Mesha Inscription (Mesha talking to Kemosh, who was the God of Moab). WE ARE GOING TO ARGUE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN ANCIENT ISRAEL WERE MONOLATREISTIC BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT YAHWEH WAS THE MOST POWERFUL DEITY BUT ALSO RECEIVED GUIDENCE FROM OTHER DEITIES, SHOWING THAT THEY DID NOT DENY THE EXISTENCE OF OTHERS WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THEM MONOTHEISTIC COMPLETELY.  <br/>  <br/>**What was most important/insightful in your readings:**  <br/>  <br/>AA by Hillers:  <br/>  <br/>\\* Canaanites were polytheistic.  <br/>  <br/>\\* There was a layer between humans and the Gods where other spirits lived. Perhaps this is where Kemosh was speaking to Mesha from.  <br/>  <br/>TEHOG by Smith:  <br/>  <br/>\\* Israelites were a monolatry before a monotheist people. There were other gods, but El/Yahweh was the only one that was really worshipped.  <br/>\\* There wasn't a denial of other Gods, but later mentioend that all other Gods were basically just a part of Yahweh.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Writing the Paper (by page)**:  <br/>  <br/>1\\. **Intro (1 Page):** Talk about how there are a lot of different deities that are mentioned throughout the Hebrew Bible (El, Asherah, Baal, etc.). State how they were all Gods for different things (Storm, Sun, etc.). Bring up the Mesha Stele and how Mesha is being influenced by someone who is not Yahweh, which proves that they believed in the existence of other deities. Argument: The ancient (Canaanites/Israelites?) were monolatreistic because they believed that Yahweh was the most powerful deity, however, based on the Mesha Inscription, we see that they still believed in and seeked guidance from others. You can also say that their is a tier system for them.  <br/>2\\. **Paragraph 1 (3/4 Page):** Start describing what went down in the Mesha Stele... Talk about Kemosh and how he was upset with his people, then Mesha came along to take over. He built things and destroyed things. He did this because Kemosh told him to. Btw Kemosh was the God of Moab.  <br/>3\\. **Paragraph 2 (1.5 Page):** Bring up Joshua 8 and COMPARE IT to the Mesha Inscription to show that this communication between deities seemed somewhat common in ancient Israel. Introduce the idea of Sharing vs. Borrowing and how it relates to these two texts. Also mention how their sharing/borrowing can be translated to the greater population of ancient Israel (\\*\\*HINT HINT, PURPOSE OF THE PAPER\\*\\*).  <br/>4\\. **Paragraph 3-4 (1 Page):** Now that you've talked about Mesha AND Joshua, start to mention how there is likely a \"tier-system\" for the ancient Israelite deities. Here is where you also bring in the secondary evidence. After all, you are saying that they are a monolatry, so now explain the level of power that each diety has. i.e.) Yahweh is the most powerful, but where does Asherah stand on the power spectrum? Omri? Baal? How about Kemosh?  <br/>5\\. **Paragraph 5 (3/4 Page):** Conclusion. Reiterate how monolatry is the best way to describe the ancient Israelites and how NO MATTER WHAT \"TIER\" A DEITY WAS, PEOPLE STILL LISTENED TO THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY, WHICH FURTHR PROVES THE THEORY OF A TIER SYSTEM.  <br/>  <br/>\\*\\* Move paragraphs 3-4 to right after the intro. You are now going to start by explaining what you mean by tier system and then looking at the evidence to support it.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-L-8tisT-k-fAcOzuOMO","timestamp":1511994617384,"title":"CnC: Second Paper Outline"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"1.

Life could be cut off without warning, so it is better to see it as an obstacle course than as life spared. Their bodies were not intrinsicely different than ours, but would last if given a chance.<br/><br/>15.) Violence was the violation of people's home from outside or from within.<br/><br/>16.) Then and now, marriage binds strangers as the greatest force for social cohesion.<br/><br/>17.) Forget about careers: think about income in terms of farming and flocks.<br/><br/>18.) Writing was information technology, mastered mainly by specialists.<br/><br/>19.) Entertainment without the internet: think festivals, drama, and a good story.<br/><br/>20.) Emotion is universal, but accounting for it is cultural.<br/><br/>21.) Oxymoron of the day: You could call monotheism a species of polytheism<br/><br/>22.)

Where human knowledge and ability fall short, religion is the essential medicine.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Terms:**<br/><br/>**Rachel:** Follows with the idea that every pregnancy was basically life or death. Women had help from midwives. Because of the pain this baby caused Rachel, she named him Benjamin (Ben oni, meaning the \"son of my affliction\"). She was the second wife of Jacob.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Dinah**: The daughter of Jacob, raped by Shechem who then asked his father to get her for him as a wife. In antiquity, it is customary that the rapist marry the victim to pay dues to the family, since the home and family are so interrelated. Simeon and Levi, Jacob's sons, killed everyone in Shechem's city and took Dinah. They also looted the city of Shechem (the whole thing about taking spoils). They did all this out of vengence.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Naomi:** Elimelek's wife. Had two sons, Mahlon and Kilion. They were Euphratites from Judah. Her husband died and her sons too eventually. She was too old to give birth again. Ruth goes with her. Now wants to be called \"Mara\" because the Lord has afflicted her. They went back to Moab. Ruth is her daughter in law.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Nanaya-Kanat:** The bride who is mentioned in the marriage contract we saw in the Kathleen Abraham text. The man who wanted to marry her had to negotiate/make a deal with her mother first. Shows that the family is still involved after marriage and that women are not just the property of their husbands.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ten Commandments:** A set of laws about how the newly freed Israelites should live and worship after the Exodus from Egypt.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Hieratic:** The precursor to the Hebrew language. Mostly used by priests.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Hittite Kingdom:** Ancient kingdom in modern day Turkey where, through their festivities, we learned what constituted as entertainment in ancient times.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Huwasi (Huwashi):** It was the standing stone in the Hitacite ritual text. A standing stone is connected to a palce... they washed and did ritual acts in front of it.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Love/Hate:** Defined as political in the ancient atmosphere, not in the way we know it now. For example, Love is attributed to Yahweh, and Hate is attributed to other GOds.<br/><br/>**El:** Another name for Yahweh. The meaning of El is \"God.\"<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Anthropomorphism:** The giving of human characteristics to a God, animal, or object.<br/><br/>**Eli:** The priest of the Shiloh sanctuary in the Hannah story.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Joseph:** Son of Jacob who was the most loved. This made the other sons dislike him very much. Matter of love/hate as political, and we also see that there is always parent loving child but never the other way around.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Shechem:** Dinah's rapist. Wanted to marry her in order to make ammends. Was killed along with the rest of the city by Simeon and Levi as revenge for what he did to their sister. Also a city which had its entire male population killed off after Shechem raped Dinah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Boaz**: Marries Ruth. Is eventually killed along with his brother.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Babylon:** An ancient town where many Judeans and other mixed groups of people lived.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Akkadian:** An ancient language that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia. The Kathleen Abraham text about marriage was written in this language.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Phoenician:** Basically just Canaanite.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Samson:** Character from Judges 16 who had his hair cut off and therefore lost his power.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Esther:** When the queen of Persia was killed for not agreeing to strip at a party, Esther became her replacement by revealing to everyone that she was Jewish. Haemin's plan to kill the Jewish people was stopped because of her.<br/><br/>**Polytheism:** The belief in and worship of multiple Gods.<br/><br/>**Yahweh:** The most powerful deity in antiquity. Referred to by many names, one of<br/><br/>them being El, and also has a history just as any other person in ancient Israel.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ain Dara:** Ancient city near modern day Syria that is notable for its temple of the same name.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Abimelech:<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Mari:** Ancient city in modern day Syria. Tablets from here date back to 1700 or 1800 BCE and were written in Akkadian. Soem of the letters show what war was like in the ancient near East. \"Love/Hat\" letter comes from here. Also tells us that war was fought between families and that takiing spoils was not uncommon.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ruth:** A Moabite woman. Married to one of Naomi's sons, who was Iraelite. Reminds us how marriage binds strangers and is an example of intermarriage.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Achaemenid Empire:** First Persian empire where a lot of exiles from Judah lived in a town called \"Town of the Jews.\" There was a lot of mixing between Judeans and other groups.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Gezer Inscription:** Gezer is an important city in ancient Israel. It was a work done by a schoolboy when he learned how to write, not a professional scholar. The isncription dates back to the 10th century and describes a calendar that is basically laid out in terms of agriculture since farming was such an important part of everyone's life.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Cuneiform:** An ancient writing system that involved characters that were impressed in clay. Mostly used in ancient Mesopotamia.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Western Wall:** The only remaining piece of the second ancient Israelite temple in Jerusalem, which was part of the courtyard from the first century renovation.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Mordecai**: Esther's relative and the leader of the Jewish people in the Book of Esther.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Aegean**: Ancient region in modern Greece.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ugarit:** Kingdom north of ancient Israel that helps us understand the Canaanite religion.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Elyon:** Another name for God.<br/><br/>**Hannah:** Wife of Elkanah. Was upset because she was infertile so she went to pray to God so that she could finally give her husband a son.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-L07oAorGFKSU5TtQOzA","timestamp":1513050127692,"title":"CnC: Final Exam Review"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"Platformer where you have to find clues to break through different blocks to get to different rooms. ....<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>djhdhddnnd  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>segrdtfghjklmjnbhgv","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-L1Fh2DNdPMzqOSRqkxl","timestamp":1514256217003,"title":"Game Idea"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">this is a note</span></p>","creator":"QDjPSPknKBU7MDc9WHON2g2Fe802","id":"-L2L_D40uA0bLsB0c-bB","timestamp":1515428569.436747,"title":"my note"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"**Overview:**<br/><br/>\\- Animate is an iPad app used to create professional quality animations right from your tablet.

You want a higher quantum so process switches only occur when they are absolutely needed.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**System Calls:**<br/><br/>*   **TRAP instruction:** Switches from user mode to kernel mode.<br/>*   **Exit:** Terminates the process (and returns status).<br/>*   **fork():** Creates an identical child process with a pid of 0. Any other pid means it's a parent.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Advantages/Disadvantages of SJF and PSJF:**<br/><br/>1.  A: Minimizes turnaround/response time<br/>2.  D: Many systems do not know in advance how long a process's cpu burst will be.<br/>3.  D: Process starvation can occur.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Arcs used to change the number of processes are **create** and **terminate** and the system calls are **fork()** and **exit()**.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\* Main Memory is usually called RAM (Random Access Memory).<br/><br/>\\* There is also ROM (Read Only Memory) which is used at boot time to load things that always need to be loaded when the computer starts, unlike things that are volatile.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ways to do Input/Output:**<br/><br/>1.  **Busy Waiting:** A user program issuses a system call, which the kernel translates into a procedure call in the appropriate driver. The driver then starts the IO and goes into a loop, constantly checking if the device is done yet. When the IO is done, the driver puts the data where it needs to go then returns.<br/>2.  **Interrupt:** When the driver starts teh device and asks it to issue an interrupt when it is finished. When the controller is done, it will issue an interrupt to signal completion.<br/><br/>\\* On the parentboard is a program called a **BIOS (Basic Input Output System)**, which contains low level IO software for reading from the keyboard, writing to the screen, and doing disk IO, etc.<br/><br/>\\* When the computer is booted, the BIOS is started. It will first check how much RAM is installed and whether the keayboard and other basic devices are responding correctly.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Multiprogramming:** The rapid switching of processes to simulate concurrency.<br/><br/>**Spooling:** The process of reading and writing online fast storage while a job is running and accessing the slower devices separately.<br/><br/>**Trap:** A system clal that atomically switches teh processor into privileged mode and jumps o a pre-defined physical address.<br/><br/>**Microkernel:** Provides just enough functionality to implement processes. An error in the file server cannot corrupt memory in the process server.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Deadlocks:**<br/><br/>*   Occur when multiple processes are trying to access certain resources, but those resources belong exclusively to the processes using them and requesting them. One cannot give up a resource until it receives the other, and the other cannot be obtained because the original was never given up. This is called a deadlock.<br/>*   Memory is an example of a preemptable resource.<br/>*   \"A set of processes is deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause.\"<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Readers Writers Problem:**<br/><br/>*   There are two classes of processes: Readers which can run concurrently and writers which need exclusive access.<br/>*   The problem is preventing two writers from being concurrent, preventing a reader and a writer from being concurrent, and permitting readers from being concurrent when no writer is active.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>FINAL EXAM<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\* Paging eliminates external segmentation<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Placement Question:**<br/><br/>Into which hole do we place a process when there are several holes that are big enough?<br/><br/>*   First Fit: Chooses the first eligable hole. First big enough.<br/>*   Best Fit: Chooses the smallest hole that first. Has to go through several times to find best hole.<br/>*   Worst Fit: Pick the largest hole and be done with it. Avoids silvers, but elimates big holes so a big job will require compaction.<br/>*   Next Fit: Same as first fit, but starts looking from where it left off.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Replacement Question:**<br/><br/>Which process should we swap out when we need to free up space in memory?<br/><br/>*   Cannot take the one where Direct Memory Access is scheduled. That one is pinned down.<br/>*   A process that has been blocked for a long time is a good choice.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**(Non-Demand) Paging:**<br/><br/>*   Program is divided into fixed size pieces called (virtual) **pages**. The user cannot see/interact with the partitioning of the program.<br/>*   The physical memory is also divided into what are called **(page) frames**.<br/>*   \\* The size of a page (**the page size**) is equal to the size of a frame (**the frame size**).<br/>*   Each page gets placed inside of a page frame.<br/>*         \\- Since all pages and frames are the same size everything fits perfectly.<br/>*         \\- Everything first perfectly so there's no **external fragmentation**.  <br/>    <br/>*   \\* The program is NOT contiguous in physical memory. The OS keeps a **page table** having an entry for each page.<br/>*         \\- The **page table entry** for page \"p\" contains the frame number \"f\" that contains page \"p\"  <br/>    <br/>*   Properties of non-demand paging:<br/>*         \\- The entire process must be memory resident to run.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The physical address is not contiguous. However the virtual address is.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- No holes, so no external fragmentation.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Non-Demand paging is NO LONGER used.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Internal Fragmentation is possible.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- A job cannot run due to insufficient memory. Eg.) A job is 50 pages but only 40 frames are available.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- There is no placement question with non-demand paging; all frames are equally good since they are the same size.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The replacement question still stands. If a job doesn't fit, another job can be swapped out.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Translate from Virtual to Physical Address:**<br/><br/>*   Virtual Address: \\[ page # | offset \\]<br/>*         \\- **Page Number = (virtual address) / (page size)**  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Offset = (virtual address) mod (page size)**  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The page number is used as an index in the page table. NOT the actual value at that index in the page table.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The value in the page table at the index \\[page #\\] is going to be the frame number for this page.  <br/>    <br/>*   Once we have the frame number, we take that to find the physical address:<br/>*         \\- **Physical Addres = ((frame #) * (frame size)) + offset**<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Ex.) Given a machine with page size PS=FrameSize=1000, what is the physical address (PA) corresponding to the virtual address (VA)=3372?<br/><br/>**=>** PA=(F# * FS) + Offset<br/><br/>FS=1000<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>P# = 3372 / 1000 = 3<br/><br/>Offset = 3372 mod 1000 = 372<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Frame# is the value contained at PageTableEntry\\[P# = 3\\], so we will create an example and say it is 459<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Now we can calculate the physical address:<br/><br/>PA = ((F# * FS) + offset) = (459 * 1000) + 372 = 459372 and we're done :)<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Demand Paging:**<br/><br/>The idea is to fetch pages from disk to memory when they are reference, hoping to get the most actively used pages in memory. Very common despite its complexity.<br/><br/>*   The PTE has the frame number for a page IF it is loaded. But what if it is only on the disk?<br/>*   The PTE has a flag indicating whether or not the page is loaded.<br/>*   When a reference is made to a non-loaded page the system has to do a lot of work.<br/>*         \\- Choose a free frame. If there isn't one, make it.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Choose a victim frame. This is the REplacement question.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Write the victim frame back to the disk if it is dirty.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Update the victim's PTE to show that it is no longer loaded.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Now we have a free frame.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Copy the referenced page from disk to the free frame.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Update the PTE of the reference page to show that it is loaded and insert the frame number.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Page Tables:**<br/><br/>*   We use datain the page table to guide our decision about with page to evict when another page is not already loaded in memory.<br/>*   Put the page table in main memory. This seems slow but it gets sped up by using a Transition Lookaside Buffer.<br/>*   The **\\# of Page Table Entries = # of Pages**<br/>*   The format of a page table entry is machine dependent.<br/>*   A Page Table Entry contains the following data:<br/>*         \\- **The Frame Number:** The field is the main reason for the table. It gives the virtual to physical address translation. The only field for non-demand paging.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Valid Bit:** Tells if the page is currently loaded. It the bit is set, the page is in memory and the frame number for the PTE is valid. If unset, then a page fault is generated by the hardware.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Modified or Dirty Bit:** Indicates that some part of the page has been written since it was loaded (basically unsaved changes). The is needed when the page is evicted so that the OS can tell if the page must be written back to the disk (i.e. saved)  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Referenced or Used Bit:** Indicates that some word in the page has been referenced recently. It is used to select a victim; unreferenced pages make good victims.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Protection Bits:**  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Transition Lookaside Buffer (TLB):** An associate memory where the index field if the page number. The other fields include frame number, dirty bit, valid bit, etc. This is small and expensive, however it is very fast.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Page Replacement Algorithms:**<br/><br/>These are solutions to the REplacement problem.<br/><br/>*   **Temporal Locality:** If a word is referenced now, it is likely to be referenced in the near future. This argues for caching referenced words (keeping the referenced word near the processor for a while).<br/>*   **Spacial Locality:** If a word is referenced now, nearby words are likely to be referenced in the near future. This argues for prefeching words around the currently referenced word.<br/><br/>Both of these methods fit under the umbrella idea of \"locality,\" meaning that once a word is referened it is likely to be used again soon.<br/><br/>*   **Belady's Min Algorithm (Optimal Algorithm):**<br/>*         \\- Replace the page whose next reference will be furthest in the future.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Generates the fewest page faults.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Unimplementable because it requires future knowledge of references.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Not Recently Used (NRU):**<br/><br/>Divides the frames into four classes and makes a random selection from the lowest, nonempty class:<br/><br/>1.  Not reference, not modified<br/>2.  Not referenced, modified<br/>3.  Referenced, not modified<br/>4.  Referenced, modified<br/><br/>\\* NRU is based on the belief that a page in a lower priority class is a better victim. In other words, if a page has not been referenced recently, locality suggests that it probably will not be referenced again soon and hence is a good candidate to evict. If a clean page (not modified) is chosen to evict, then the OS does not have to write it back to disk and hence the cost of the eviction is lower than for a dirty page.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**FIFO PRA:**<br/><br/>*   It's just fifo, the first one loaded is the first one evicted.<br/>*   Implementation is to have a queue of nodes each referring ot the resident page.<br/>*         \\- When a page is loaded, a node referring to the page is appended to the tail of the queue.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- When a page needs to be evicted the head node is removed and the page referenced is chosen as the victim.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Second Chance PRA:**<br/><br/>Similar to the FIFO PRA, but altered so that a page recently referenced is given a second chance.<br/><br/>*   When a page is loaded, a node referring to the page is appended to the tail end of the queue.<br/>*   The list is maintained in apparent order of loading. The R bit of the page is cleared.<br/>*   When a page needs to be evicted, the head node is removed and the page referenced is the potential victim.<br/>*   **Case 1:** If the R bit is unset (the page hasn't been referenced recently), then the page is the victim.<br/>*   **Case 2:** If the R bit is set, the page is given a second chance. Specifically, the R bit cleared, the time of loading is changed to NOW, and the node referring to this page is appended to the rear of the queue (so it appears to have just been loaded) and the current head node becomes a potential victim.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Clock PRA:**<br/><br/>Same as 2nd Chance, but uses better implementation, namely a circular list with a single pointer serving as both head and tail pointer.  <br/><br/>We assume that the most common operation is to choose a victim and replace it by a new page.  <br/><br/>*   We use a circular list for the nodes and have a pointer pointing to the head entry. Think of the list as the hours on a clock and the pointer as the hour hand.<br/>*   The operation we need to support efficiently is replace the \"oldest, unreferenced\" page by a given new page.<br/>*   Examine the node pointed to by the clock hand. If the R bit of the corresponding page is set, we give the page a second chance: clear the bit, advance the hand, and examine the next node.<br/>*   Eventually we reach a node whose R bit is clear. The corresponding page is the victim.<br/>*   Replace the victim with the new page.<br/>*   Update the node to refer to this new page.<br/>*   Move the hand forward another hour so that the new page is at near.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Least Recently Used (LRU):**<br/><br/>When a page fault occurs, choose as victim that page that has been unused for the longest time. Meaning the least recently used one.  <br/><br/>*   Keep a count of how frequently each page is used and evict the one that has the lowest score. Specifically:<br/>*         \\- Include the counter (and reference bit R) in each PTE  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Set the counter to zero when the page is brought into memory.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Every k clocks, perform the following for each PTE:  <br/>    <br/>*               \\- Add R to the counter  <br/>    <br/>*               \\- Clear R  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Choose as victim the PTE with the lowest count.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\*\\* Review Deadlock and how to prevent it, what is a safe state, etc.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-L6ZP5ReAFuPVfjUAslR","timestamp":1519955503012,"title":"Operating Systems Final Exam Review"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"<p

H.R.S = Hudson River School<br/>2.  A.C.S = Ashcan School<br/>3.  Anything about staircases is most likely by Edward Hopper. You probaly have like an 70-80% chance of getting it right if you guess Hopper for any staircase painting.<br/>4.  Anything involving a \"street scene\" is most likely by George Luks and was probably done between 1900-1910... That's a pretty good guess if you are not sure.  <br/>    <br/>5.  The John Sloan works that you need to know are mostly from 1912.<br/>6.  The ones with a lot of people in a really paintery style are most likely by Orozco and are from 1931 (within 5 years of that).<br/>7.  Colorful silhuette paintings with lots of blues, reds, and oranges are liekly Aaron Douglas and are from 1934.<br/>8.  Any sculptures that are at the Rockefeller center and have like a Roman look to them were made between 1933-1936.<br/><br/>**Important to Know:**<br/><br/>*   Tenth Street Studios at 51 West 10th St. 1857-1956. This is where much of the avante-garde 19th-20th century art work was created. People ate, slept, and worked in their studios.<br/>*   **Hudson River School:** Painters who wanted to stick to traditional art forms.<br/>*   **Ashcan School:** Painters who wanted to paint life as it was, realistically. Palette is usually dark. Started by a group of painters known as \"The Eight.\"<br/>*   View of the Armory Show - 1913<br/>*   Seeing New York with a Cubist: The Rude Descending a Staircase (Rush hour at the subway) - 20 March 1913.... This is supposed to be a political cartoon type of thing about Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending A Staircase.<br/>*   Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art, NYU<br/>*     <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Art Movements:**<br/><br/>*   **Romanticism:** A worshipping of the romance languages. This kind of art is supposed to speak to us. Sensational because it triggers ours senses and makes us feel something.<br/>*   **Impressionism:** Monet, for example. Artists begin with a white background and add color instead of a black background and adding light.<br/>*   **Photography:** Became popular in the 1930s.<br/>*   **Fauvism:** Fauve is French for wild animal. This movement is supposed to be wild and childlike, in an attempt to recapture childhood innocence.<br/>*   **Cubism:** A sort of 4th dimensional look to paintings?<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Works to Know (by date):**<br/><br/>*   **Frederic Edwin Church (HRS)** \\- The Heart of the Andes - 1859<br/>*   **James Abbot McNeill Whistler (HRS)** \\- Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket - 1875<br/>*   **Mary Cassatt (HRS)** \\- Little Girl in a Blue Armchair - 1878<br/>*         \\- Influenced by Japanese wood block art.  <br/>    <br/>*   **William Merritt Chase** \\- Interior of the Artist's Studio - 1882<br/>*   **Jacob Riis** \\- Five-Cent Spot - 1888-1889<br/>*   **Childe Hassam** \\- Washington Arch, Spring - 1892<br/>*   **Henry Ossawa Tanner** \\- View of the Seine Looking Toward Nôtre Dame - 1896<br/>*         \\- First African-American artist to gain national acclaim.  <br/>    <br/>*   **John Singer Sargent** \\- Mr. and Mrs. I.

Used sticks, knives, towels, etc.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- A feeling of sublime... Evokes a strong emotion just by looking at it similar to Barnett Newman's Vir Heroicus Sublimis from 1951.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Perfect example of Action Painting.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Painted on the floor  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The canvas was a stage to act.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**George Tooker:**<br/><br/>*   The Subway, 1950:<br/>*         \\- Post war anxiety...

Similar to Jackson Pollock's Number 31.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Possibly addressing his anxiety over being a closeted man.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It looks very messy, like a battlefield. As in, he is fighting his inner demons.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- One of his first \"combines,\" where he takes a traditional canvas and a found object.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Rauschenburg says that painting relates art to life and that he just acts in the space between.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Jasper Johns:**<br/><br/>\\* All about challenging the seriousness and heroic subjectivity of the time.<br/><br/>\\* You think you are so high and mighty and know what the art is about, but you don't.<br/><br/>*   Target with Plaster Casts, 1955:<br/>*         \\- Similar to Charles Demuth's I Saw The Figure 5 in Gold.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Painted box with flaps that open up. Inside are all human body parts.  <br/>    <br/>*   Flag, 1954:<br/>*         \\- During the age of McCarthyism. What does it realy mean to be American?  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- By painting this picture, does that make Johns more American than someone else?<br/>*         \\- There are also news articles in the background of the painting, which relates to the news in America.  <br/>    <br/>*   Painted Bronze, 1960:<br/>*         \\- You think you know what you're looking at but you don't.  <br/>    <br/>*         -  <br/>    <br/>*   False Start, 1959:<br/>*         \\- Again an example of thinking you know something but you don't.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is a bunch of color splotches, but each one has the name of a different color than it is painted in.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Again, not taking art too seriously and being ironic.  <br/>    <br/>*   Painting with Two Balls, 1960:<br/>*         \\- Yes, this is a sexual reference. The painting literally \"has balls.\" Johns was trying to be funny.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Alluding to his sexuality in this painting.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is about the arise of gay visual asthetic that came with the demise of AbEx  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Yvonne Rainer:**<br/><br/>*   The Mind is a Muscle, 1966:<br/>*         \\- The Judson Dance Theater at the Memorial Church of the same name.<br/><br/>**Claes Oldenburg:**<br/><br/>*   The Street, 1960:<br/>*         \\- At Judson Gallery  <br/>    <br/>*         -  <br/>    <br/>*   The Store, 1961:<br/>*         \\- All art galleries are just a store, so why not call them for what they are?  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- They're literally just people going around, seeing what they like, and buying it.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Showed the influence that consumerism had on the art world.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Lisette Model:**<br/><br/>*   War Rally, 1941-45:<br/>*         \\- Supposed to show a proud, true American.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- He is standing tall and holding an American flag.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- During the time of McCarthyism, people wanted nationalism.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Helen Levitt:**<br/><br/>*   New York, 1940:<br/>*         \\- A very dynamic photo of children in the city.<br/>*         \\- The importance of this photo is how Levitt captures so much action.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is very difficult to do this ^. The Winogrand Tilt is also present here.  <br/>    <br/>*   Kids with Masks, 11940:<br/>*         \\- Another example of dynamic photography.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- All the kids are posed so interstingly, but none of it is one purpose.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is the natural essence of childhood. The inherent grace of childhood.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Roy DeCarava:**<br/><br/>*   Graduation, 1949:<br/>*         -  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Garry Winogrand:**<br/><br/>*   World's Fair, New York, 1964:<br/>*         \\- Very dynamic. Everyone has their own story.<br/>*         \\- Related to Jackson Pollock's \"One: Number 31\" because of there is so much going on.  <br/>    <br/>*   Demonstration outside Madison Square Garden, New York, 1968:<br/>*         \\- Again, extremely dynamic. You just want to know everyone's story.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Just by nature, everyone in the photo is wearing glasses.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Diane Arbus:**<br/><br/>*   Triplets in their bedroom, N.J., 1963:<br/>*         \\- Very square photography style, opposite of Winogrand.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Style was developed at The New School under her studies under Lisette Model<br/>*   Two Ladies at the Automat, NYC, 1966:<br/>*         \\- Another square photo  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Somewhat of a sad style to her photos.  <br/>    <br/>*   A young Brooklyn family going for a Sunday outing, NYC, 1966:<br/>*         \\- A very sad looking photo, as per her usual style.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The parents look very serious, as in they are upset that this is their life now.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The children seem to be a heavy burden for them.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- They look like the kinds of people who like to go out and adventure, but having children has made them take a step away from that life.  <br/>    <br/>*   Child with toy hand grenade in Central Park, 1962:<br/>*         \\- The photo makes it look like the boy is going to do something bad.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is all about context, when you see the rest of the photo shoot.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Andy Warhol:**<br/><br/>*   Saturday's Popeye, 1961:<br/>*         \\- Referencing the comic book/tv character Popeye  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Art does not have to be so serious as it was for Warhol's predecesors.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Wanted to make art accessible for everyone. What better way to do that than with Popeye?  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- TV and mass media was becoming huge, which meant that this kind of art became more popular.  <br/>    <br/>*   Campell's Tomato Soup, 1962:<br/>*         \\- Created in steps. First a pencil stencil (no, he did not draw each one scratch). Then he hand painted the can and label. Finally, the gold fleur-de-lis were made using a stamp.<br/>*         \\- What is interesting is that each can is still different. They are different flavors of soup (tomato, chicken, etc.). They also vary slightly in tone.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The number of canvases relates to the mass production of actual soup cans. It is supposed to be like a grocery store, where everyone can pick one up and take it home.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- They are, in grid style, arranged in order of introduction. So Campell's Tomato soup comes first.  <br/>    <br/>*   Gold Marilyn Monroe, 1962:<br/>*         \\- Hugely iconic painting of his. Inspired many other works today such as Madonna's album cover.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Warhol made many works similar to this. He would exaggerate the colors and tones though.  <br/>    <br/>*   Ether Scull 36 Times, 1963:<br/>*         \\- Warhol's first commissioned work.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Scull was the wife of an art collector and Warhol created lots of different images of her with different colors and in different poses.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- A photobooth style effect.  <br/>    <br/>*   Blue Electric Chair, 1963:<br/>*         \\- Warhol may have had a sort of interest with the deaths of people.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The electric chair is not a happy thing, but he makes it easier to look at by coloring the scene blue and putting a solid blue panel right next to it.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- He put two panels on it because it made him more money.  <br/>    <br/>*   Empire, 1964:<br/>*         \\- He was also a film maker. This film was 8 hours long and just featured the Empire State Building changing throughout the day. Yes, that was the whole movie.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- He did this because he wanted people to talk, get up, get food, etc. while they were watching it.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-LBCa0GN2icf6xzsDAwx","timestamp":1524941460593,"title":"Expressive Cultures Final Review"},{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"1.

This lets you define integers in a different range than -2B - 2B. The range is now 0 - 4B.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Runtime System:** The thing that enforces the semantics of a programming language. Adds a lot of extra code. CANNOT be part of the operating system because it has to work for different programming languages.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Switch Statements:  <br/>  <br/>\\- Switch statements only work for ints and chars. They do not work for floats, arrays, doubles, etc.  <br/>  <br/>\\- You can't do \"and\" in a switch case. You can do \"or\" by typing...  <br/>  <br/>switch(something) {  <br/>  <br/>case 1:  <br/>  <br/>case 7: \\*something\\* break;  <br/>  <br/>}  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>\\* Memory slots are only big enough to hold **1 BYTE**. This is because the smallest data type in any programming language is \"char\" which is one byte.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Pointers:  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>/_  <br/>  <br/>Passing a pointer type into a function.

The range goes from 0 to 2^n - 1 where n is the number of bits.  <br/>  <br/>\\- For example, a short is 2 bytes so it has 16 bits. Then the range of an unsigned short is 0 -> 2^16 - 1  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**B2U(X)** = The sum from i = 0 to (w - 1) of xi_2i  <br/>  <br/>\\_ You can never get more than 1 bit as an overflow no matter what.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>One's and Two's Complements:  <br/>  <br/>Ex.) 110  <br/>  <br/>then... - (001 + 1) ==> 010 ==> -2  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Ex.) 10100 --> Keep all the zeros and first 1 from the right, then flip everything else.

For example, if you set an integer to greater than or less than it's bounds, you will get an incorrect number that will not be easily found when debugging your code.  <br/>\\* We need the assembler so that **professional programmers can optimize their code by comparing the assembly to high level code** and also because the **compiler and assembler do two different jobs and do not need to be mixed together to add complication**.  <br/>\\* The Assembler is **machine dependent**.  <br/>\\* Checks if a number is odd: (_a++) & 0x1  <br/>_The compiler is both **machine and language dependent**.  <br/>\\* REMEMBER: a << 3 = 2^3_a  <br/>_Know how to convert signed, unsigned, hexadecimal, binary, decimal, all that mess...  <br/>\\* Review the last question on the midterm fall 16  <br/>  <br/>\\* If the Carry Flag is 1 for unsigned numbers then there is an overflow.

There were plots of land called binau that were owned as bodies that were defined by tabinau.<br/>*   **Second Description:** The tabinau has different meanings in different contexts. In one context it's a house/dwelling. It was also a person/persons related to the speaker by ties of land. All rank, recognition, job, etc.<br/>*   Land is not owned, even corporately.<br/>*   Land is made by work, what people do to serve it past and present.<br/>*   Kind of like a family structure - people grouped together by the land they live on.<br/>*   The people of the tabinau are past and present so that their spirits can be tied to their land.<br/>*   Land without people is NOT tabinau.

Israel had some association with wilderness and they're portrayed as mobile, hurding people, meaning that they are shepards on the move.

Jerusalem existed before Israel. From the 14th Century we have letters from Jerusalem, not Israel.<br/>2.  Jerusalem keeps the same small scale that it had before Israel when it becomes a capital.<br/>3.  We cannot excavate the temple mount, which is where we would have found both Solomon's Temple and the Royal Palace. We know they are there from descriptions in the Bible.<br/>4.  Jerusalem was first a major city in the 8th century.<br/><br/>\\* Jerusalem is all over the Bible. It is \"Judah's City\". What we know is what the people told us, so we are getting it from their perspective.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Fact 12: Israel's antithesis is Jerusalem, where the center defines the whole.<br/><br/>Meaning that the way we learned about Israel as a name and not as a city, and its basic nature, it is a collection of people and not defined by a center.

Find everything that allows a woman to lead, state it explicitly or unstated. What do you think?_<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Monday, 10/23/17**  <br/><br/>**Topic of the Day:** Women rising to power? How do they do it, what kinds of struggles do they face? etc. How do you get to be a woman ruler?  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Judges 4 & 5 (song of Deborah) -- Deborah**<br/><br/>*   Through God. Only if God decides to speak to you. _\\* Prophet *_ \"The Lord, the God of Israel, commads you...\" God speaks through her (Deborah).<br/>*   Judges 5:7 - \"Until I arose, a mother in Israel.\"<br/>*   It's a delicate thing to be a woman in leadership.<br/>*   Chapter 5 praises Yahweh, then shifts to call to battle.<br/>*   Collaboration with a man.<br/><br/>Understand about this text:<br/><br/>1.  She is a prophet in chapter 4, and has the role of deciding disputes (judge/leader). She is introduced portrayed with these leadership skills, she doesn't develop them throughout the story. * Think in terms of institutions. * She does have authority, but it is, in some sense, voluntary... because of who she is; it is not institutionalized. The basis for this authority is RELIGIOUS.  <br/>    <br/>2.  Her authority is rooted in perceived access to divine power (God). According ot the Bible, there were no legitimate women prophets.<br/>3.  Deborah is given a husband (Lappidoth) in the beginning. Whether or not he is a husband or not, he has no role in the story. She was not a \"woman of the house\" in any way. Why is she called a mother in Israel? Has nothing to do with being a mother in the way you know it to mean.<br/>4.  The occassion in both chapters is war. Even though she has such authority, the thing that is in view is a military crisis. _\\* Barak is a military commander, but it's kind of like Deborah appointed him just because she needed a male collaboration *_.<br/>5.  Identification of Deborah as a mother only comes in the poem (Song of Deborah). Not in the household. Her being a \"mother\" is a way of explaining the character of her authorities. As a mother, you're not just a mother/queen/tied to a man. She doesn't depend on any man.<br/><br/>\\* Not normal to have this type of authority. Only possible by religious legitimation (she has a direct line to God because of who she is). Not to be duplicated, one time special thing. *<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**2 Kings 11 -- Athaliah**<br/><br/>*   Had to be plausible succession to overthrow her (Athaliah). She is not from the House of David. She was still in the royal family so she was close enough. She is kind of declaring an end to the HOD (House of David).<br/>*   She actually ruled, actually had a lasting effect, ruled for six years.<br/>*   What it took to overthrow her was a plausible return to the royal family. They hid (find name) in a temple and saved him so that he could take over after Athaliah. He was seven years old when he started his reign.<br/><br/>Things to remember about this story.<br/><br/>1.  The story, it's negative, not positive.<br/>2.  There is no divine legitimization. Athaliah does not have God on her side, her power is purely institutional. She only comes to power by the institutions that are in place. (She married into the royal family, is the mother of the previous king, etc. something like that). She manipulates teh institution by killing all the male heirs to make it impossible to take over.<br/>3.  She does have some legitimacy. After all, she did rule for six years.<br/>4.  It's in Judah, NOT in Israel. Remember that.<br/>5.  Who do you think she wanted to follow her? It's not clear what would happen next, especially because she dismantled the entire system. The King died, she's not going to have another son.<br/>6.  Her authority is derived from being a mother (the mother of the previous king). There's the connection to Deborah.<br/>7.  The main threat to her authority comes from institutional religion. The priest of the temple puts him up and says that he is to be king now (the seven year old boy, find his name).<br/><br/>\\* It doesn't matter how close to the actual events these stories are, what's important is a tradition out of the kingom of Israel, whearas on the Judah side you see how centralized it is. *<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Fact 13: Traditional structures gave group authority to men, but powerful women could rise as mothers.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Monday, 10/30/17**  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Life Expectancy in Ancient Israel in Genesis 35.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Questions to think about: What do you learn from this about life and death?

In the larger narrative, Rachel waits years before this. So she's not young.  <br/>    <br/>2.  Every pregnancy was life or death. Not to say that the majority of them died in childbirth, but there was something to fear. Shows how scary life could be in that moment for both women and men.<br/>3.  Women did have help when it came to childbirth: the midwife, who was kind of a professional.<br/>4.  The name, Ben'ami, which shows how serious childbirth was taken.

How do you get your hands on hard currency? It doesn't happen.  <br/>\\* Shay's Rebellion, 1786-1787  <br/>\\* \\- Shays was being sued and so he got a bunch of people together to shut down the courts. None of the Rev.

By the end of that summer, they came out with a brand new thing that didn't resemble the Articles at all.  <br/>  <br/>Ratification:  <br/>  <br/>\\* Enough states had to vote in favor of the new document.

The latter meant JA and JQA. Think about Trump/Hilary today.  <br/>\\* Fierce Indian fighter/frontier settler made Jackson attractive to those who resented the East Coast's wealth and political power.  <br/>\\* Increased suffrage was radical.  <br/>\\* Dorr War in Rhode Island, 1842.  <br/>\\* (Thomas Wilson Dorr - couldn't vote cause he didn't own land, ran for some other political office, got votes illegally, went to jail).  <br/>\\* Support of statse over federal government.  <br/>\\* \\- As president, things were more complicated!  <br/>  <br/>\\* \\- **Nullification Crisis:** were federal laws superior to state laws? A bill \"nullified\" the ToAbom., but is that allowed?  <br/>  <br/>\\* \\- The Force BIll - The Federal Gov't could use force to enforce federal laws.  <br/>  <br/>\\* What to do about the BUS?  <br/>\\* Control credit, enforce connection between specie and printed money?  <br/>\\* Poor farmers and frontiersmen prefer state banks.  <br/>\\* Jackson starves the bank/bank calls in loans: known as the Bank War.

Industrial Revolution<br/>*   Trail of Tears/Indian Removal<br/>*   Era of Good Feelings/BUS/Henry Clay<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Timeline of Important Events from 1820-1858:<br/><br/>*   Missouri Compromise (1820): Missouri would be admitted as a slave state and Maine would be admitted as a free state. Also drew the 36-30 parallel to stop slavery above that line going westward... Later on, at what point was the Civil War inevitable?<br/>*   Election of Andrew Jackson (1828): Explotation of female slaves more than before. Election represents a cultural shift to an idea of masculinity of white plantation owners. Jackson was against a federal government. Wants to expand westward whether that meant getting rid of Indians, expanding slavery, etc.<br/>*   Indian Removal Act (1830): Conflict with Native Americans in Illinois. During Jackson's pres., his first major push toward Indian Removal.<br/>*   Black Hawk War (1832): \\*look this up later\\*<br/>*   Texas Revolution (1836): Texas was huge with cotton. Even if you weren't for-slavery you understood the economic importance of it. White plantation owners really want to keep slavery, some other people don't (don't remember who). Battle of the Alamo, fighting for rights.<br/>*   Panic of 1837 with the BUS (1837): A bubble in three markets: Cotton, Land, Slaves. Banks have been giving out loans that people couldn't pay back. The price of cotton drops, banks worry that plantation owners won't be able to pay off loans so they call in loans early. Everything starts failing, leads to financial panic (recession near depression). Affects North and South. People start to question to financial side of slavery.<br/>*   Greatest proportion of immigrant influx to the US (1845-1854):<br/>*   Annexation of Texas (1845):<br/>*   Mexican American War (1846):<br/>*   Compromise of 1850 (1850):<br/>*   Republican Party Founded (1854): First party to contest a party that has anti-slavery as it's national platform.<br/>*   Kansas Nebraska Act (1854): Territories that want to become states, instead of Missouri Compromise, the voters of the state will determine if they want slavery in their state or not. Basically cancels out the Missouri Compromise.<br/>*   Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857): Enslaved man was brought into a free territory does not become free even though he had lived there for a long time. Was slavery political or sexual. Decided that the rules of slavery apply everywhere and not just where slavery exists.<br/><br/>\\* Did slavery help the growth of capitalism?","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-KtmQ9nA6L_BTKZlYXhB","timestamp":1505158277481,"title":"Recitation US History"},"-Ktw42MZLQySlzEBdyGV":{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"**Wednesday, 9/13/17**  <br/><br/>Virtual Machine:<br/><br/>*   Hardware/Software<br/>*   Operating Systems<br/>*   Applications (Process)<br/><br/>\\* Interace between hardware and sofware are instructions.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-Ktw42MZLQySlzEBdyGV","timestamp":1505320251996,"title":"Recitation Computer Systems Organization"},"-Kv3Zp3SYlbtlpJlpZQ6":{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"**Paper 1:**  <br/><br/>**Cabeza de Vaca Reading Notes:**  <br/><br/>*   Governor Pánfilo de Narváez's expedition started on June 17th, 1527.

Notice how the author refers to him as a protagonist int he beginning of this story. - pg. 48<br/>*   \"Cabeza de Vaca was a man of slender physique in his mid-thirties. He hailed from Jerez de la Frontera, a parched but attractive Andalusian town about 50 miles due south of Seville.\" - pg.48<br/>*   CabDev was the oldest boy of his five siblings. At the age of 18 he became an orphan after his parents passed away and he had to care for his siblings... He got military experience - pg.49<br/>*   It's likely that Narv. didn't have much of a say in CabDev joining the expedition - pg. 50<br/>*   \"Captain Andrès Dorantes and Alonso del Castillo were nearly as prominent as Cabez de Vaca.\" - pg.50<br/>*   Women were included in the Florida expedition. There were ten women on this voyage and they were all married and traveling with their husbands. - pg.54<br/>*   \"\\[Estebanico\\] was a vivacious, outgoing, and curious young man with a remarkable facility for languages.\" - pg. 56<br/>*   Overcrowding was an issue on the voyage. It seems like the sea journey was pretty bad, with rotten food, lack of fresh water, lots of sharing having to be done and with their hands, etc. - pg. 60<br/>*   They found themselves in a hurricane. This caused them to postpone the departure date because they had to replace lost ships.<br/>*   So far, much more detailed about time than CabDev's account.<br/><br/>Chapter 4<br/><br/>*   \"During this time, the rift between Narv. and CabDe. deepened. The Royal Treasurer had wanted from the outset to remain close to the coast and reestablish contaact with the ships as soon as possible. Yielding to the majority, he had been forced to march inland. After two weeks of arduous marches, CabDev. had become ever-more convinced that his plan was the right one.\" - pg.93<br/>*   At first Narv. did not want to hear anything about going to the coast because it was too far. He eventually sent CabDev to lead 40 men to the coast.<br/>*   CabDev.'s plan failed so they went with Narv.'s plan<br/>*   Apalachee was the largest and most complex cheifdom of the Florida peninsula.<br/>*   \"Narv. ordered CabDev. to take nine cavalrymen and fifty foot soldiers and attack the village.\" - pg.100<br/>*   \"Apalachee was hardly the \"sparsely populated\" land described by the hostages\" - pg.102<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Chapter 4 of CabDev:<br/><br/>    \\- It seems like CabDev was just very sure of himself here. I don't think there was any sort of argument or conflict, necessarily. It was more like just a frustrating situation where CabDev really believed he was right and if not understand Narv.'s decision. IMO CabDev was right - they were ill equipped to (land/stay/dock/go)? and so it would be better to (do the opposite of that?).  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Chapter 10 of CabDev:<br/><br/>    \\- I can tell now that CabDev is getting annoyed with Narv. because he keeps wanting to do the opposite of what he says. I still don't think there is any strong hate, though, based on CabDev's account. It is more like a lot of frustration like \"why don't you listen to me? Why do you always want to do the opposite of what I say\"  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Chapter 5 ALSS<br/><br/>    \\- After a Greek man and a slave were captured by the Indians, Narv. basically told everyone to fend for themselves because it was time for everybody to do what they thought was best to survive. The people on Narv's ships were about to die of starvation and could not row out to sea, which is what CabDev. wanted. He was sailing to a third ship that was drifiting out to sea. - pg. 127<br/><br/>    \\- Narv. was pretty selfish. He got to sleep in a raft while the others slept on the shore in the way of a possible Indian attack - pg. 131  <br/><br/>\\*\\* For a couple of chapters there really isn't much about the relationship between CabDev. and Narv.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\- A lot of it is about CabDev. acting as the medicine man through religion. - Chapter 8- 9<br/><br/>\\- Wait a minute!

Using DuVal's Independence Lost and the negotiations among the British, the Choctaw, and the Chickasaw (including Payamataha) in 1765, write a paper addressing the following questions: **Why was Payamataha successful in his pursiut of peace? Why was this peace threatened after his death?**_<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Independence Lost:**  <br/><br/>*   Payamataha and his people did not want to fight in the revolution. They wanted peace.<br/>*   Payamataha had the leading role among the Chickasaws. - loc. 397<br/>*   Decades before Paya. was born, in the mid-1720s, the British and the Chickasaws fought TOGETHER against the French and other Indian enemies. Now the topic of the essay makes sense, the Chickasaws have a long history with the British and want to keep peace with them and enemies with the French. It is this long history that made the British hope that Paya.'s people would assist them again in the war against the rebels (the colonists) and anyone else who joined their side. - loc.397<br/>*   Payamataha's story is different because he and his people did not want to fight on the either side of the war (not helping the British). They wanted to maintain peace. - loc. 404<br/>*   Being a warrior was the standard path to leadership for Chickasaws.<br/>*   Paya. depended on persuasion and goods distribution for his influence. - loc. 410<br/>*   The Chickasaws had slaves that they captured in battle. But the children of their slaves were often not slaves themselves. Some could even move up in rank or be free of slavery. Apparently, southern plantation slavery was an anomaly in the history of the Americans, Europe, Africa, and Asia slavery. - Chp.2 loc. 410<br/>*   \"Payamataha still followed his ancestors’ assumptions that the world was divided not into a few “races” but into thousands of different peoples—the big divide was between Chickasaws and all non-Chickasaws, not between Indians and non-Indians.\" - DuVal, Kathleen. Independence Lost: Lives on the Edge of the American Revolution (Kindle Locations 525-527). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.  <br/>    <br/>*   Chickasaws were known as the most ferocious group of Native Americans, and had very good stirke-retreat strategies to maintain their population.<br/>*   \"Neighbors called them 'the most military people of any about the great river,' meaning the Mississippi.\" - loc. 424<br/>*   Starting in 1729, the Chickasaws got into a lot of wars with the French. This made their alliance with the British even stronger.<br/>*   Wars with the French, including disease, decreased security for the Chickasaws, and caused many of them to move to fortified towns on a ridge overlooking the region. Many of them were persuaded to leave Chickasaw country and live as refugees. - loc. 431<br/>*   By the Seven Years' War, there were only about 1600 Chickasaws living in Chickasaw country. They lived in a town called Big Town - loc. 431-438<br/>*   Payamataha means \"war leader\" or \"war prophet.\" He grew up in these fortified Chickasaw towns during the time in which war was escalating quickly. - loc. 438<br/>*   As a child, Paya never showed signs of being a peacemaker. He was a natural born warrior, killing over 40 men on his own, hunting, gathering war titles, etc. - loc. 445<br/>*   In an encounter with the Creeks, Paya. had to defend the British even though the Creeks said they encroached on their territory more than the French did. He referenecd the civil war of the Choctaws as proof that the French can turn the Native Americans against each other. - loc. 464<br/>*   \"The Chickasaws 'would not be idle lookers on; the cause of the English should be theirs, in opposition to French, Cherokee, and all other enemies,' which could certainly include Creeks.\" - loc. 471<br/>*   By the time the French had left North America, ending the Seven Years' War, Paya. had become the headman in charge of war and diplomacy.<br/>*   Despite being a warrior in the past and holding the office of \"head leading warrior\" Paya. did not \"turn warrior\" like some of the other peace chiefs at the time. He decided to end Chickasaw warring. That was the only way to save the population - loc. 485<br/>*   Paya wanted to turn warpaths back into trade routes. He met with other choctaw leaders to discuss ending their decades of war. They signed a peace treaty in May 1759, one of the most successful peace treaties in history. Decades of war became permanent peace. - loc. 491-498<br/>*   Paya. made peace with a lot of old enemeis: Choctaws in the south, Cherokees and Catawbas in the east, Creeks in the southeast, and Quapaws in the west.<br/>*   \"Had most women opposed his peacemaking efforts, he would have failed.\" - loc. 498<br/>*   \"Payamataha's power came in part from the spiritual world, and his exhortation to make peace was based on a spiritual calling to avoid war.\" - loc. 506.<br/>*   \"Payamataha agreed with Nativists that Indians should not fight one another, but jhe disagreed that the solution was to fight Europeans. Payamatatha's movement focused on getting along with everyone no matter their history.\" - loc. 520<br/>*   Payamataha saw himself as almost like the white people, because white was the color of peace for southeeastern Indians (due to the lack of red, for blood). He thought this way because of all the connections and benefits he gained from the British. - loc. 535<br/>*   Paya. defied what the British wanted (to basically only be allied to them) and allied with Spanish Louisiana. This is because Paya. did not want to make any other European enemies.<br/>*   Paya. brokered peace between the Choctaws and the British.<br/>*   \"In 1772, Nativist messages circulated through the south, urging that if 'the English, France, and Spain are at war\\[,\\] all the red people is to be at peace.'\" - loc. 571<br/>*   For two decades, Paya. worked with other Chickasaw leaders to help change their place in the world form warriors to peace.<br/>*   After his death, the Chickasaw leaders found it difficult to remain independent while other confederacies grew around them and tried to combine to increase their power. - loc. 5104<br/>*   Alexander McGillivray's plan for the Chickasaws to join a Southern Confederacy that would combine with a Northern Confederacy to basically fend off \"illegal immigrants.\" This would threaten Chickasaw independent foreign policy making and possibly pull them back into war - loc. 5115<br/>*   McGillivray wanted the southereastern Indians to surrender some of their independence to be allied against the Americans.<br/>*   Conflict increased between the Creeks and the Chickasaws. The Creeks wanted to assassinate Piomingo and other Chickasaw leaders for exercising their own nation's independent foreign policy. Paya.'s policy of peace with everyone was no longer possible. - loc. 5383<br/><br/>**Payamataha Primary Source**  <br/><br/>*   Payamataha is part of some kind of gathering of leaders.<br/>*   It is a meeting to settle for peace and alliance between the Americans or British and the Natives. That's why Paya. is there. It's a meeting that took place over several days. - pg. 216<br/>*   There is a religious component here, that God gave them the victory and that now they are to make peace. - pg.224<br/>*   According to Paya., a white man settled outside of the Chickasaw village and ruined their crops?. They wanted to make sure that this would not happen again. - pg. 224<br/>*   The symbol of a \"white wing\" or just something white in general shows up on page 225. When the Natives hold it, they do not let anything bad come from their mouths. - pg. 225<br/>*   Religion continues to play a role in the attempt for peace.<br/>*   King George is like a protector of the Natives? - pg. 228<br/>*   I think it is talking about King George and his power of the Natives/Colonists.<br/>*   The Chickasaws and Choctaws should live together in harmony under one father, the Great King. - pg. 235<br/>*   \"That past offences be forgot & Buried in Oblivion, that no other Emulation or Strife do Exist in your Nations, But who shall be most Dutyfull to His Father & most Affectionate to His White & Red Brethren.\" - pg. 235<br/>*     <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Thesis Ideas:**<br/><br/>*   It's possible that Paya.'s history as a warrior is what allowed him to understand that peace is a better option than fighting.<br/>*   His peaceful efforts were successful because he was determined to keep his people safe by avoiding war. He also gained a lot of his respect and power from persuasion and goods distrubition, which must have helped him underestand the idea of compromise in negotiations.<br/>*   It seems more like a matter of just trying in the first place to have peace with other nations. Before, Chickasaws were seen as the most military people of the southeastern Indians, and becacuase of Paya.'s level of respect among his people as a leader, he got to set the tone for the entire commmunity. Imagine the coolest kid in school who gets to decide what is cool for everyone, basically like that.<br/>*   This peace was threatened after his death because he was no longer there to enforce the peace. Now you want to think of it as someone who starts a legacy somewhere and then has to pass it on to someone else; there is always the possibility that it will not be as good because the original person's vision is not there anymore, not matter how hard the next person tries.<br/>*   Unfortunately, because Paya. was not there anymore, the new people in charge did not know how he would have reacted to certain situations, ultimately causing them to fall back into trouble when they could not make the right decision for peace or war. This then followed a spiral effect until things just got out of hand.<br/><br/>Organizing Paper:<br/><br/>1.  Intro ( ~ 1 page )<br/>2.

It is mentioned in the first line but that's it. Then it talks about other women falling in love with David, but never really anything about him loving them back.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>1 Samuel 20:<br/><br/>*   Saul wants/tries to kill David.

David says he loved Jonathan very much, like a brother, which shows how close they were. But the fact that he also says that it is more than his love of women makes it seem like he doesn't understand why he loves him more than women, he just knows that he enjoys Jonathan's company and would rather spend time with thim than any woman.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Gilgamesh Penn I:<br/><br/>*   \"As for the axe, its form was strange.\" - line 31.

By the counsel of the god it was declared, and at the cutting of his navel-cord, she was designated for him.\" - Col. IV lines 159-163. It says a few lines before that the family net is open for the one who chooses. Maybe this means that the person getting married has the right to marry anybody they want? If so, then maybe the line about the navel-cord references his birth and how he may have been born homosexual but wasn't really aware of it.<br/>*   \"At the words of the young man, his \\[Enkidu's\\] face turned pale.\" - line Col.

Then talk about how in history it is likely that we came across homosexual figures but do not get much information about it because it wasn't something they talked about openly back then.<br/>2.  **(1 Pages)** **Section 1**, look specifically at the words from 2 Samuel 1:19-27 and Glgamesh 24-36. Think about what the words mean metaphorically and how they describe a sexual scene. What abouts what they're saying helps you define an image of love.<br/>3.  **(1 Pages) Section 2**, Read 1 Samuel 18-20 and then the entire Gilgamesh Penn tablet.

They have a very specific political viewpoint, which is why we can't take it as completly right. Put the Bible at the table, but there are many different viewpoints that we are not getting because this was written so specifically.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Sennacherib's Annals**: Senn. is the king of Assyria. It provides a very different view of the (something?). You can find this in 2 Kings 18-19.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Tanakh: Torah (Teaching/Law; the authoritative part of the Jewish religion.)<br/><br/>Prophets: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings explicity tied to Israel's narrative).

He missed that the tabinaeu had different meanings based on context. The first is in a family setting, the second is (look it up in notes). He understood the difference in context in his second description.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>First: Tabniau was a patrilocal (defined by a father) extended family (out of the nuclear family) and a patri-lineage (lineage by the father). It was a corporate, land-holding unit (there were plots of land called binau and they were hed/owned by bodies that were defined by the tabinau: gardening plots, routes could all be applied).<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Second: The tabinau has different meanings in different contexts; In one context it is a house or a dwelling: Person(s) related to the speaker through ties of land (if you share tabinau land (garden:))<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Prayer to the Gods of the Night**<br/><br/>**Psalm 82:** In the Bible; has the mention of Elohim (El = god, Elohim = gods).<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\* To make foreign means to decontextualize.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\-\\-\\-\\- Class 5: Defining History ----  <br/><br/>Fact: Your history is your life and so was theirs.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**_\\*Very Important for this Fact\\*_**  <br/><br/>**Geoff Eley**: Defines social history.<br/><br/>**Social History**: Enough attention to kings and power.

Why would they tell the story from someone who wasn't a king?<br/><br/>\\* The term \"myth\" is important. We talked about fallacy of origins. Do not take them as history.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\-\\-\\-\\- Class 8: The Roel of Archaeology ----  <br/><br/>Fact: Archaeology gives reality without spin -- until historians get to it.<br/><br/>This fact is pretty self explanatory... It is about how historians have to make a decision about things they find.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Willian Dever and Avraham Faust**: Both want to look at archaeology without using the Bible. They are minimalist. This is as opposed to a maximalist, who would who the Bible extensively to find meaning in arcaheology.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Izbet Sartah:** The houses that formed the elliptical. Israel Finkelstein is the one who excavated this site. It may reflect mobile people who were settling before moving again.

Doesn't mention Israel, but does say Yahweh because Israel is the people of Yahweh. Dates back to around 600 BCE.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Song of Deborah** \\- Deborah gained power divinely; the Lord spoke directly to her. Deborah is a female leader in antiquity, a prophet and had the role of deciding disputes. Her authority is rooted in perceived access to divine power. Her husband is Lappidoth, although he has no real role in the story. She is \"a mother of Israel\" but not a mother in the sense that we know it. A leader before kings.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Nevi'im** \\- The second part of the Hebrew Bible, the name meaning \"Prophets.\" It is all stories about the prophets and contains the book of Judges, book of Joshua, etc...<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Mesha Inscription** \\- Carved on a black basalt stone measuring 1.15m high. It was discovered by Alsatian missionary Frederik Klein at Dihban in 1868. The inscription has broken down over time and because of the amount of interest in it; the ending is missing, but 2/3 were able to be pieced together. It was written in Moabite and dates back to around 835 BCE. Mesha is the son of Kemosh, and he followed in his father's footsteps by being a ruthless ruler. He was known for tearing things down and destorying places and their people. Came after the division of Israel into the Northern and Southern kingdoms. Look to Joshua 8 for evidence, as we are dealing with people/kingdom with one particular God who organizes their warfare. Herem is utter destruction on behalf of a God, which is celebrated in this text (obedience for divenly inspired acts). Victory followed sacrifice. Has no relation to the Bible.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Emar** \\- Dates back to 13th century BCE Syria. \"Emar\" is a site on the map, close to modern day Syria. The story of Hayabeginsmakes and his daughter, Dada, whom he made both mother and father of the household. Inheritance by a prostitute<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Schneider's \"second description\"** \\- The term \"tabinau\" has different meanings based on the context.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Samaria** \\- The capital of Israel, as defined in the Merenptah Stele.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**586 BCE** \\- Babylon destroyed the Kindom of Judah. Babylonians exiled the people of Judah. No longer independent people living in this land.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Judah** \\- The centralized, capital of Jerusalem. The king is always the son of the previous king, and you can constrast this to the Northern Kingdom of Isreal, where the royal family can change because the king is chosen by the people.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Moses** \\- Leads the Israelites out of Egypt. Story of Exodus.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Rehoboam** \\- The son of Solomon. When asked by the people if he could lighten up on them he asked the advice of his elders and of his peers. He ended up going with his peers, telling the people that he would be even tougher on them than his father was. Evidence comes from 1 Kings 12. Remember that this is Israel, not Judah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Genesis** \\- Story of the creation of the world. Ends with Moses and the story of Exodus.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**el-Amarna** \\- The Amarna Letters, which were correspondences between Egypt nad Canaan. If there was a such thing as \"Israel,\" it would have been written about in these letters. They were written in Akkadian in the 1350s BCE, which is BEFORE Meremphta and close to Exodus. It doesn't mention anything about Israel.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Four Room House** \\- Weaving and how it allowed women to sell things outside hte home. We made this connection because we're using the Biblical texts (if the men are not there, they are out in battle, then the women must be at home weaving). Making an assumption that women will be in homes.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Esther** -<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Tel Dan Inscription** \\- First widely accepted reference to the name David as the founder of a Judahite polity outside of the Hebrew Bible. One of four contemporary steles that mentions Israel. Tells about Hazaal, ruler of Aram, and his victories over Omri and his ally, the king of the House of David.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Jezreel Valley** \\- Large expanse of fertile land and valley near the Galilee region where many Israelite battles were fought.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Isaiah** \\- Prophet who wrote the book of Isaiah. This book details how other Gods are just defined as other than Yahweh?<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Yahweh** \\- The name of the Israelite dieity, the national God of the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Tanakh** \\- Name of the Hebrew Bible.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ketuvim** \\- The third part of the Hebrew Bible, the name meaning \"Writings.\" It contains the books Psalms, Proverbs, The Scrolls, Daniel, etc..<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Moab** \\- City that was destroyed by King Mesha? (Re-read Mesha Inscription)<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Assyria** \\- Known as a land of very strong, violent people. King was Sennacherib, who attacked and captured all the people and cities of Judah. This was apparently done as a divine act. Sennacherib was punished for disrespecting the God of Israel by having 185k of his soldiers killed during the night before he planned a seige on Jerusalem.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Tabinau of the Yap people** \\- A patrilocal (defined by a father) extended family and a patrilineage (lineage by the father). Two different descriptions given by David Schneider. The first is defined as a patrillocal extended family, a patrilineage is defined by a father. Everything goes through the father, as he is the head of the household. Also is a corporate (meaning communal) landholding unit. There were plots of land called binau that were owned as bodies that were defined by tabinau. The second definition is that taibnau has different meanings depending on the context.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Jerusalem** \\- Sacred Kingdom of Jerusalem. Existed before Israel, we know this because from the 14th century we have letters from Jerusalem but not Israel. Archaeologists are not allowed to excavate it even though that is where we would find Solomon's Temple and the Royal Palace. We know these are there from descriptions in the Bible. A major city in the 8th century. It is \"David's City\" and we only know as much as the people tell us. It is the capital of Judah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Iron Age** \\- 1200 BCE and ends in 586 BCE. Time period when most of the events of ancient Israel take place.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Abraham** \\- First person God spoke to. Was about to sacrifice his son, Jacob to please God, but when God saw this he decided not to take Jacob.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Joshua** \\- From the Book of Joshua, we found out that Joshua was also capable of destroying entire civilizations, similar to Mesha. In Joshua 8, he is told by the Lord to attack Ai, and he did not hesitate to take an army and complete the task. By the end of the story, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the laws of Moses and read it aloud, word for word.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Izbet Sartah** \\- Dates back to the 12th century (1110s), and comes AFTER Merenphtah. It comes BEFORE the book of Kings and would be a part of the book of Judges (there are leaders before kings). Little rooms surrounding an elliptical shaped area. Sheep and other animals were kept along the outisde of the circle. Followed an egalitarian setup, meaning there was no social hierarchy. All houses were just about the same size. There is no writing found, and for this reason we cannot associate the people who lived there to a specific group. They may have reflected Israeli people and people who were very mobile, but we are not sure. The site was very small, as was the population.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**\"Social History\"** \\- Not looking at history through the kings and queens and other royal people. To get a true sense of the times we must look at history through the eyes of the common people, the everyday people. This is what George Eley asserted. He became a historian in order to impact how people look at the past, especially the poor.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Theophoric personal name** \\- A name that carries/embeds that name of a God, such as Daniel, Jonathan, Nathaniel, Samuel, etc.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Little Israel** \\- The little expanse of land between the Dead Sea and somewhere up higher. It is the original, small settlement of Isreal before David and Solomon's expansion . Imagined image of Israel is the larger one with all the different tribes together, making the Bible a more powerful text. The name Israel has a geography, but there is not a very specific definition of Israel geographically. For example, Merenphta refers to Israel as a people rather than a location.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Damascus** \\- Capital of Syria. Major city in the in the Aram-Damascus empire that fights against Israel.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Saul** \\- The first ruler of united Israel (both Noth and South) in the Book of Kings. He is the father of Jonathan, and David's son was Solomon. Tried to kill David (think about the Gilgamesh paper). When he was killed (think around the time of the Gilgamesh paper you wrote) his son, David, took over. David's son is Solomon, who was a very tough ruling king, and _his_ son, Rehoboam, tells the people of Israel that he will be even tougher than his father.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Merenptah Stele** \\- The first reference to Israel in the Bible, coming in 1207 BCE. Because of this we know that Israel existed at this time. Egyptian tablet talking about the people Merenptah conquered in 1207 BCE. The Egyptians were controlling Canaan at the time.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Torah** \\- The first five books of the Hebrew Bible, and is also known as Pentateuch. The name Torah means \"Teachings.\" Book of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Jezebel** \\- The daughter of Sidon. Also married to Ahab. Apparently does a lot of bad things like getting the people of Israel to worship Ba'al.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Akhenaten** \\- The Sun God. Ruled over Akhetaten. Changes the city of Akhetaten to modern day El-Amarna.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Babylon** -<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Aram** \\- Aramaean state near Damascus i nthe 12th century. An important Aramaean stele is the Tel Dan Inscription.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**722/720 BCE** \\- Marks the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem (North) by the Assyrians. The Assyrian Empire moves into the North and dismantles the Kingdom of Israel, leaving only the Southern Kingdom (Judah). This is told about in the 1st and 2nd Book of Kings.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**House of David** \\- AKA the Kingdom of Judah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Jacob** \\- Also known as \"Israel.\" The 12 tribes of Israel are his sons. When people hear the name Jacob they realize they have a common ancestor.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Solomon** \\- The son of David. Known for being very tough on his people. His son is Rehoboam.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Exodus** \\- Ancient Egypt. Israelites are told to kill the first born son of every Jewish person, so one mom lets her son go in a basket in the river; this is Moses. He is adopted into a family and his adoptive brother becomes Pharoh. When Moses sees the Israelites being poorly treated by the Egyptians he asks the Pharoh to free them but he denies. Then God killed the Pharoh's first born son and he was really upset about this. In his rage he allowed the Israelites to go free, but when he called down he told his army to get them back. This is when Moses split the Red Sea (covered in blood because of God's disapproval of the poor treatment of the Israelites). Moses then closed the Sea on the army that was folllowing them and they made it to Israel, but Moses was not allowed in because he reacted angrily to something that God decided to do.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Canaan** \\- The land given to Abraham by God.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Shechem** -<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Athaliah** \\- Mother of the king. She is NOT from the House of David, but she was still in the royal family. Killed all male heirs to the throne so that she could rise to power. She actually ruled and had a lasting effect (six year rule). What it took to overthrow her was a plausible return to the royal family, in which (find name later) was hidden away in a temple so that he could overthrow her; this happened when he was 7 years old. Her story, 2 Kings 11, is a negative one. Athaliah has no divine power, it is purely institutional.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Shalmaneser III** \\- King of Assyria who led a successful compaign against the kingdom of Israel in the 800s BCE. He is the one who was king when Assyria destroyed the kingdom of Israel in 720 BCE.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Omri** \\- King of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. He is important because he became king not because of his bloodline but because the people elected him in. He was some kind of military commander. Remember, this is Israel (North), anybody can become king because it is not based on lineage. Evidence for this comes in 1 Kings 16:15-20.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**City of David** \\- (Core of the settlement) Jerusalem.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Michal** -","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-KwuMavgplDMXcJFyKLC","timestamp":1508512787847,"title":"CnC: Midterm Review"},"-L-8tisT-k-fAcOzuOMO":{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"**Paper Info:**  <br/>  <br/>**Lecture:** 3  <br/>  <br/>**Fact**: Israel was another not so splashy, Middle Eastern people, unique like you are to your mother.  <br/>  <br/>**Primary Evidence**: Mesha Stele  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence:**  <br/>  <br/>\\- \"Analyzing the Abominable: Our Understanding of Canaanite Religion\" by Delbert Hillers  <br/>  <br/>\\- \"The Early History of God\" by Mark S. Smith  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Steps:**  <br/>  <br/>1\\. Read primary evidence  <br/>2\\. Read secondary evidence  <br/>3\\. Write paper  <br/>  <br/>**In Reading the Primary Source**:  <br/>  <br/>1\\. What is it that you want to understand about the evidence? For the warrior-bond topic, I issued a challenge; this time you must choose your own. You cannot simply describe the evidence as if that mattered in itself. Why is the evidence significant for understanding ancient Israel or the world in which it was embedded? There is no single answer. You must decide what interests you and define a research problem in light of it. This objective will be addressed in sections, and your teaching assistant and I are available for consultation.  <br/>  <br/>2\\. Even as you will have a specific angle of pursuit, you need to understand your evidence completely in order to evaluate properly that specific question in light of the material’s full character. For Jonathan and David, that meant working through all of the textual content relevant to defining the relationship between them. Work systematically.  <br/>3\\. With your specific question in mind, make detailed observations, looking for features that could illuminate the issue of concern. Watch especially for surprises, aspects that you did not notice at first. Don’t worry about what others have noticed or what they think; what are you learning that you would not have thought until this moment?  <br/>  <br/>4\\. Working from your specific research interest, yet still before trying to read outside interpretations and without yet meaning to write your paper, come up with a draft hypothesis, what the evidence suggests to you based only on your own observations. This means answering your own question from the available evidence. Propose your own interpretation, specifying the exact evidence relevant to the question and developing a rigorous line of reasoning to support your interpretation.  <br/>  <br/>**In Reading the Secondary Source:**  <br/>  <br/>1\\. Have they already discovered your most important observations? If so, do they see them exactly as you have? Do they apply them likewise or differently?  <br/>2\\. What are the research questions that drive their projects and how do these align with or differ from yours? What are the implicatiosn of these alignments and divergences? Look for where their work can help you toward your own destination. Never let them set the agenda, even as they may transform the way you approach your own.  <br/>3\\. Where do they disagree with you? So far as this is true, is it based on something they know that you did not, and you have to shift direction? Believe it or not, even as a non-expert, you have the same core evidence, and you may have an argument to prove them wrong. Stick to your guns, if you can see this! Somethimes they are simply approaching a problem with something different in mind, and you still have a way forward.  <br/>4\\. Even where their interests may head in a direction different from yours, do they provide you information that can advance your own progress? Some readings can offer very targeted help.  <br/>5\\. NOTE: I propose that you should aim to have cited roughly FIVE sources of specialist study. Not all topics will lend themselves to this. More sources can be one way of showing depth and effort. In the end, however, your papers will show their quality by the effort and thought put into the analysis of primary evidence, and that analysis will be the principal bassi for our evaluation.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Background:**  <br/>  <br/>**Important to Remember:**  <br/>  <br/>\\* This topic has to do with the differences and similarities between **Borrowing** and **Sharing**  <br/>\\* It is about the question of uniqueness.  <br/>\\* Remember that it relates to Joshua 8.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Primary Evidence 1: Mesha Stele**  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Similarities between Mesha Inscription and Joshua 8 (from professor):  <br/>  <br/>1\\. We are dealing w/ a people or kingdom and a God who organizes their work there.  <br/>2\\. Both texts celebrate victory by a sequence of divinely inspired acts. Battles initiated by the God  <br/>3\\. Obedient execution leads to success. Not fear, just obedience. Doing what the Gods tell you.  <br/>4\\. Victory means slaughter, especially by inhabitants of a city.  <br/>5\\. Herem. The same rare word for divinely \\*attack?\\* is slaughter.  <br/>6\\. Sacrifice post-victory  <br/>7\\. Victory followed by building, especially a shrine for the people's God. (Destruction then  <br/>  <br/>_**Mesha Inscription:**_  <br/>  <br/>\\* The inscription was carved on a black basalt stone measuring 1.15m high and 60-68cm wide. It was discovered by Alsatian missionary Klein at Dihban in 1868.  <br/>\\* The original stone was demolished because there was a lot of interest in it by the Europeans in Palestine. The pieces were made into amulets.  <br/>\\* The end of the inscription is completely lost, while 2/3 of it were able to be pieced together in the Louvre museum.  <br/>\\* The text on the inscription was written in Moabite (roughly Israelite Hebrew) and dates back to around 835 BCE. It belongs to the genre of building inscirptions.  <br/>\\* Mesha is the son of Kemosh.., and is the king of Moab, the Dibonite. He took over after his father's rein of 30 years.  <br/>\\* Mesha looked down on all of his enemies and was deliered from all kings.  <br/>\\* Omri was the king of Israel and he oppressed Moab for many days, according to the text. Kemosh was angry with his land and when his son, Mesha succeeded him, he said that he, too, will oppress Moab.  <br/>\\* Mesha, in the land of Medeba, built Baal Meon, a water reservoir, and built Kiriathaim.  <br/>\\* Mesha fought against the people of the city of Ataroth, and won, killing all their poeple as sacrifice for Kemosh and for Moab.  <br/>\\* Mesha also attacked and killed the population on Nebo.  <br/>\\* \"I have built Karchoh, the wall of the woods and the wall of the citadel, and I have built its gates, and I have built its towers, and I have built the house of the king, and I have made teh double reservoir for the spring in the innremost part of the city.\" - Mesha Inscription, Mesha's Building Activites at Karchoh.  <br/>\\* Mesha talks a lot about how he built things, but then in a lot of places he talks about how he destroyed things and killed the people there.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Primary Evidence 2: Joshua 8**  <br/>  <br/>**_Joshua 8_**  <br/>  <br/>\\* \"Then the Lord said to Joshua, 'Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai.'\" - Joshua 8.1  <br/>\\* It seems that Joshua already did the same thing to Jericho and its King, but this time he should take its plunder and livestock for himself.  <br/>\\* Joshua sent his army of 30k soldiers to attack Ai. Then told them to set fire to it at the end.  <br/>\\* Joshua did not draw back the hand that held the javelin until all the people of Ai had been killed and the city burned down.  <br/>\\* Joshua then built an altar to the Lord on Mount Ebal, as he was instructed by Moses.  <br/>\\* Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses. He then read all the words of the law - the blessings and the curses - just as they were written in the Book of the Law.  <br/>  <br/>\\* In Joshua 8, we also see the idea of a higher power influencing a human just like in the Mesha Stele. Joshua just did what the Lord told him to do without question.  <br/>  <br/>\\* There are layers (kind of) (from highest to lowest): Powerful Deities/El/Yahweh - Other Deities/Kemosh/Asherah - Humans  <br/>  <br/>\\* Here is sort of different than the Mesha Stele because it is the Lord, not some other deity, speaking to Joshua so there is that direct connection as opposed to in Mesha where it is (based on our other knowledeg) a second-tier deity, if you will.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence 1: AA by Dilbert Hillers**  <br/>  <br/>**Notes for the Hiller Text:**  <br/>  <br/>\\* Canaanites were polytheistic. Think about this in terms of King Mesha and how he was almost \"spoken to\" by his late father. They have multiple Gods who they pray to.  <br/>\\* \\- Also refer to Joshua 8 where Joshua is spoken to directly to invade that city.  <br/>  <br/>\\* \"Those names of deities which have a plain sense, such as Baal (\"Lord\") and Mot (\"Death\"), show thaat the Canaanite religion was \"in this respect, at least, more primitive and nearer its fountainhead than the others.\"\" - pg. 260  <br/>\\* Canaanite is being characterized as \"primitive\" by someone named Albright and Hillers is trying to prove that wrong. - pg. 260  <br/>\\* Determining what is primitive is a matter of perspective, according to Hillers. - pg. 260  <br/>\\* **\\* There are many important figures in the Canaanite religion *** \\- pg. 261  <br/>\\* \"In dealing with paganism, Kaufmann does not offer the sort of catalogue of deities which scholars have frequently prepared, but attempts to locate a fundemental, underlying idea. This turns out to be \"the idea that there exists a realm of being prior to the gods and above them, upon which the gods depend, and whose decrees they must obey.\"\" - pg. 261  <br/>\\* \"The deities of Ras Shamra are a community of husbands and wives, fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, who contend with each other, build each other houses, sacrifice, make banquets, and so forth.\" - pg. 261  <br/>\\* \"From this view of the gods \\[^ the one above\\] as dependent on what lies outside them, as originating in a separate world-stuff, come conceptions of the possibility of mixing the divine with the human and a ready theory of magic, which is an invocation of 'self-operating forces taht are independent of the gods.'\" - pg. 262. **This idea makes sense in terms of the Mesha Inscription.**  <br/>\\* \"\"The pagan conceives of the gods as powers embodied in nature,\" we read, but is this true of El, for example, a principal deity?... he is paternal, aged, wise, just, and compassionate - a picture more obviously related to roels in human society than to 'nature.'\" - pg. 263  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence 2: TEHOG by Mark Smith.**  <br/>  <br/>**Notes for the Smith text:**  <br/>  <br/>\\* The Ugaritic tablets discovered in 1929 at Ras Shamra on the coast of Syria date back to the second half of the second millennium B.C.. These tablets have provided a lot of insight into the religion of the Canaanites. - pg. 2  <br/>\\* The Canaanites were the neighbors of the Israelites. These Ugaritic texts help to shine light on the relationship between these two groups. - pg. 2  <br/>\\* There was the idea that because deities like El, Asherah, Baal, Anat, and Omri (I think?) were Canaanite they could not be Israelite. \"According to this view, Israel had always been essentially monolatrous; Israel worshipped only Yahweh, although it did not deny the existence of other deities. While Israel could tolerate other peoples' worship of their deities, Yahweh was ultimately the most powerful deity in the cosmos.\" - pg. 2  <br/>\\* **Monolatry**: The worship of one God without the denial of the existence of others.  <br/>\\* \"Accordingly, Exodus 15:11 asks, 'Who is like you among the gos, O Yahweh?' It was Israel's monolatry that led to the monotheism just before and during the Exile (587-539), when Israel explicitly denied the power of all other deities. Whatever influence other deities manifested in ancient, monolatrous Israel, scholars often considered them syncretistic, peripheral, ephemeral, or part of Israel's 'popular religion' and not its 'official religion'.\" - pg. 3  <br/>\\* \\*\\* Page 3 is important.  <br/>\\* The other deities besides El were not really worshipped much, if at all. It was really just El who was the most powerful. - pg. 4  <br/>\\* The names of deities has little to do with people's devotion to them - pg. 5  <br/>\\* **Convergence**: The coalescence of various deities and/or some of their features into the figure of Yahweh. Basically, all the aforementioned deities were basically just parts of Yahweh/El.  <br/>\\* **Differentiation**: Of Israelite cult from its \"Canaanite\" heritage. This process began with the rejection of Baal worship in the 9th century.  <br/>\\* Monotheism was a product of the Israelites' exile from Egypt. - pg. 11  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence 3:**  <br/>  <br/>Notes for ...  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Secondary Evidence 4:**  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>What is your topic: The Mesha Inscription and the question of uniqueness.  <br/>  <br/>Possible Research Questions/Argument:  <br/>  <br/>1\\. Is it requried that the male heir to a throne continue his father's legacy?  <br/>  <br/>2\\. **Based on the primary evidence given to us in the Meshs Inscription, we find the in Ancient Israel many actions were carried out to please a higher power. In the Mesha Inscription, we find King Mesha conquering groups of people in order to continue/avenge his father's work.**  <br/>3\\. - This is probably because being spoken to directly by a spirit or God is a very special event. Basically, if a God tells you to do something, you do it. It seems that this was the mindset for Joshua in Joshua 8 and now here where King Mesha is building and destroying in the name of his father.  <br/>  <br/>4\\. - The divine is the most important aspect in being a ruler in antiquity. The greatest and most legitimate power comes from God.  <br/>  <br/>5\\. Can we argue that the ancient Canaanites/Israelites were polytheistic or that they were monotheistic but could still pray to other Gods, such as in the Mesha Inscription (Mesha talking to Kemosh, who was the God of Moab). WE ARE GOING TO ARGUE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN ANCIENT ISRAEL WERE MONOLATREISTIC BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT YAHWEH WAS THE MOST POWERFUL DEITY BUT ALSO RECEIVED GUIDENCE FROM OTHER DEITIES, SHOWING THAT THEY DID NOT DENY THE EXISTENCE OF OTHERS WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THEM MONOTHEISTIC COMPLETELY.  <br/>  <br/>**What was most important/insightful in your readings:**  <br/>  <br/>AA by Hillers:  <br/>  <br/>\\* Canaanites were polytheistic.  <br/>  <br/>\\* There was a layer between humans and the Gods where other spirits lived. Perhaps this is where Kemosh was speaking to Mesha from.  <br/>  <br/>TEHOG by Smith:  <br/>  <br/>\\* Israelites were a monolatry before a monotheist people. There were other gods, but El/Yahweh was the only one that was really worshipped.  <br/>\\* There wasn't a denial of other Gods, but later mentioend that all other Gods were basically just a part of Yahweh.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>**Writing the Paper (by page)**:  <br/>  <br/>1\\. **Intro (1 Page):** Talk about how there are a lot of different deities that are mentioned throughout the Hebrew Bible (El, Asherah, Baal, etc.). State how they were all Gods for different things (Storm, Sun, etc.). Bring up the Mesha Stele and how Mesha is being influenced by someone who is not Yahweh, which proves that they believed in the existence of other deities. Argument: The ancient (Canaanites/Israelites?) were monolatreistic because they believed that Yahweh was the most powerful deity, however, based on the Mesha Inscription, we see that they still believed in and seeked guidance from others. You can also say that their is a tier system for them.  <br/>2\\. **Paragraph 1 (3/4 Page):** Start describing what went down in the Mesha Stele... Talk about Kemosh and how he was upset with his people, then Mesha came along to take over. He built things and destroyed things. He did this because Kemosh told him to. Btw Kemosh was the God of Moab.  <br/>3\\. **Paragraph 2 (1.5 Page):** Bring up Joshua 8 and COMPARE IT to the Mesha Inscription to show that this communication between deities seemed somewhat common in ancient Israel. Introduce the idea of Sharing vs. Borrowing and how it relates to these two texts. Also mention how their sharing/borrowing can be translated to the greater population of ancient Israel (\\*\\*HINT HINT, PURPOSE OF THE PAPER\\*\\*).  <br/>4\\. **Paragraph 3-4 (1 Page):** Now that you've talked about Mesha AND Joshua, start to mention how there is likely a \"tier-system\" for the ancient Israelite deities. Here is where you also bring in the secondary evidence. After all, you are saying that they are a monolatry, so now explain the level of power that each diety has. i.e.) Yahweh is the most powerful, but where does Asherah stand on the power spectrum? Omri? Baal? How about Kemosh?  <br/>5\\. **Paragraph 5 (3/4 Page):** Conclusion. Reiterate how monolatry is the best way to describe the ancient Israelites and how NO MATTER WHAT \"TIER\" A DEITY WAS, PEOPLE STILL LISTENED TO THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY, WHICH FURTHR PROVES THE THEORY OF A TIER SYSTEM.  <br/>  <br/>\\*\\* Move paragraphs 3-4 to right after the intro. You are now going to start by explaining what you mean by tier system and then looking at the evidence to support it.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-L-8tisT-k-fAcOzuOMO","timestamp":1511994617384,"title":"CnC: Second Paper Outline"},"-L-SNUgS8n97e4qMqtpN":{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"1.

Life could be cut off without warning, so it is better to see it as an obstacle course than as life spared. Their bodies were not intrinsicely different than ours, but would last if given a chance.<br/><br/>15.) Violence was the violation of people's home from outside or from within.<br/><br/>16.) Then and now, marriage binds strangers as the greatest force for social cohesion.<br/><br/>17.) Forget about careers: think about income in terms of farming and flocks.<br/><br/>18.) Writing was information technology, mastered mainly by specialists.<br/><br/>19.) Entertainment without the internet: think festivals, drama, and a good story.<br/><br/>20.) Emotion is universal, but accounting for it is cultural.<br/><br/>21.) Oxymoron of the day: You could call monotheism a species of polytheism<br/><br/>22.)

Where human knowledge and ability fall short, religion is the essential medicine.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Terms:**<br/><br/>**Rachel:** Follows with the idea that every pregnancy was basically life or death. Women had help from midwives. Because of the pain this baby caused Rachel, she named him Benjamin (Ben oni, meaning the \"son of my affliction\"). She was the second wife of Jacob.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Dinah**: The daughter of Jacob, raped by Shechem who then asked his father to get her for him as a wife. In antiquity, it is customary that the rapist marry the victim to pay dues to the family, since the home and family are so interrelated. Simeon and Levi, Jacob's sons, killed everyone in Shechem's city and took Dinah. They also looted the city of Shechem (the whole thing about taking spoils). They did all this out of vengence.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Naomi:** Elimelek's wife. Had two sons, Mahlon and Kilion. They were Euphratites from Judah. Her husband died and her sons too eventually. She was too old to give birth again. Ruth goes with her. Now wants to be called \"Mara\" because the Lord has afflicted her. They went back to Moab. Ruth is her daughter in law.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Nanaya-Kanat:** The bride who is mentioned in the marriage contract we saw in the Kathleen Abraham text. The man who wanted to marry her had to negotiate/make a deal with her mother first. Shows that the family is still involved after marriage and that women are not just the property of their husbands.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ten Commandments:** A set of laws about how the newly freed Israelites should live and worship after the Exodus from Egypt.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Hieratic:** The precursor to the Hebrew language. Mostly used by priests.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Hittite Kingdom:** Ancient kingdom in modern day Turkey where, through their festivities, we learned what constituted as entertainment in ancient times.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Huwasi (Huwashi):** It was the standing stone in the Hitacite ritual text. A standing stone is connected to a palce... they washed and did ritual acts in front of it.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Love/Hate:** Defined as political in the ancient atmosphere, not in the way we know it now. For example, Love is attributed to Yahweh, and Hate is attributed to other GOds.<br/><br/>**El:** Another name for Yahweh. The meaning of El is \"God.\"<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Anthropomorphism:** The giving of human characteristics to a God, animal, or object.<br/><br/>**Eli:** The priest of the Shiloh sanctuary in the Hannah story.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Joseph:** Son of Jacob who was the most loved. This made the other sons dislike him very much. Matter of love/hate as political, and we also see that there is always parent loving child but never the other way around.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Shechem:** Dinah's rapist. Wanted to marry her in order to make ammends. Was killed along with the rest of the city by Simeon and Levi as revenge for what he did to their sister. Also a city which had its entire male population killed off after Shechem raped Dinah.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Boaz**: Marries Ruth. Is eventually killed along with his brother.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Babylon:** An ancient town where many Judeans and other mixed groups of people lived.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Akkadian:** An ancient language that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia. The Kathleen Abraham text about marriage was written in this language.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Phoenician:** Basically just Canaanite.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Samson:** Character from Judges 16 who had his hair cut off and therefore lost his power.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Esther:** When the queen of Persia was killed for not agreeing to strip at a party, Esther became her replacement by revealing to everyone that she was Jewish. Haemin's plan to kill the Jewish people was stopped because of her.<br/><br/>**Polytheism:** The belief in and worship of multiple Gods.<br/><br/>**Yahweh:** The most powerful deity in antiquity. Referred to by many names, one of<br/><br/>them being El, and also has a history just as any other person in ancient Israel.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ain Dara:** Ancient city near modern day Syria that is notable for its temple of the same name.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Abimelech:<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Mari:** Ancient city in modern day Syria. Tablets from here date back to 1700 or 1800 BCE and were written in Akkadian. Soem of the letters show what war was like in the ancient near East. \"Love/Hat\" letter comes from here. Also tells us that war was fought between families and that takiing spoils was not uncommon.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ruth:** A Moabite woman. Married to one of Naomi's sons, who was Iraelite. Reminds us how marriage binds strangers and is an example of intermarriage.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Achaemenid Empire:** First Persian empire where a lot of exiles from Judah lived in a town called \"Town of the Jews.\" There was a lot of mixing between Judeans and other groups.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Gezer Inscription:** Gezer is an important city in ancient Israel. It was a work done by a schoolboy when he learned how to write, not a professional scholar. The isncription dates back to the 10th century and describes a calendar that is basically laid out in terms of agriculture since farming was such an important part of everyone's life.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Cuneiform:** An ancient writing system that involved characters that were impressed in clay. Mostly used in ancient Mesopotamia.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Western Wall:** The only remaining piece of the second ancient Israelite temple in Jerusalem, which was part of the courtyard from the first century renovation.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Mordecai**: Esther's relative and the leader of the Jewish people in the Book of Esther.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Aegean**: Ancient region in modern Greece.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ugarit:** Kingdom north of ancient Israel that helps us understand the Canaanite religion.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Elyon:** Another name for God.<br/><br/>**Hannah:** Wife of Elkanah. Was upset because she was infertile so she went to pray to God so that she could finally give her husband a son.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-L07oAorGFKSU5TtQOzA","timestamp":1513050127692,"title":"CnC: Final Exam Review"},"-L1Fh2DNdPMzqOSRqkxl":{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"Platformer where you have to find clues to break through different blocks to get to different rooms. ....<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>djhdhddnnd  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>segrdtfghjklmjnbhgv","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-L1Fh2DNdPMzqOSRqkxl","timestamp":1514256217003,"title":"Game Idea"},"-L2L_D40uA0bLsB0c-bB":{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">this is a note</span></p>","creator":"QDjPSPknKBU7MDc9WHON2g2Fe802","id":"-L2L_D40uA0bLsB0c-bB","timestamp":1515428569.436747,"title":"my note"},"-L2M2mJWj8S6nWv2ePpg":{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"**Overview:**<br/><br/>\\- Animate is an iPad app used to create professional quality animations right from your tablet.

You want a higher quantum so process switches only occur when they are absolutely needed.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**System Calls:**<br/><br/>*   **TRAP instruction:** Switches from user mode to kernel mode.<br/>*   **Exit:** Terminates the process (and returns status).<br/>*   **fork():** Creates an identical child process with a pid of 0. Any other pid means it's a parent.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Advantages/Disadvantages of SJF and PSJF:**<br/><br/>1.  A: Minimizes turnaround/response time<br/>2.  D: Many systems do not know in advance how long a process's cpu burst will be.<br/>3.  D: Process starvation can occur.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Arcs used to change the number of processes are **create** and **terminate** and the system calls are **fork()** and **exit()**.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\* Main Memory is usually called RAM (Random Access Memory).<br/><br/>\\* There is also ROM (Read Only Memory) which is used at boot time to load things that always need to be loaded when the computer starts, unlike things that are volatile.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Ways to do Input/Output:**<br/><br/>1.  **Busy Waiting:** A user program issuses a system call, which the kernel translates into a procedure call in the appropriate driver. The driver then starts the IO and goes into a loop, constantly checking if the device is done yet. When the IO is done, the driver puts the data where it needs to go then returns.<br/>2.  **Interrupt:** When the driver starts teh device and asks it to issue an interrupt when it is finished. When the controller is done, it will issue an interrupt to signal completion.<br/><br/>\\* On the parentboard is a program called a **BIOS (Basic Input Output System)**, which contains low level IO software for reading from the keyboard, writing to the screen, and doing disk IO, etc.<br/><br/>\\* When the computer is booted, the BIOS is started. It will first check how much RAM is installed and whether the keayboard and other basic devices are responding correctly.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Multiprogramming:** The rapid switching of processes to simulate concurrency.<br/><br/>**Spooling:** The process of reading and writing online fast storage while a job is running and accessing the slower devices separately.<br/><br/>**Trap:** A system clal that atomically switches teh processor into privileged mode and jumps o a pre-defined physical address.<br/><br/>**Microkernel:** Provides just enough functionality to implement processes. An error in the file server cannot corrupt memory in the process server.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Deadlocks:**<br/><br/>*   Occur when multiple processes are trying to access certain resources, but those resources belong exclusively to the processes using them and requesting them. One cannot give up a resource until it receives the other, and the other cannot be obtained because the original was never given up. This is called a deadlock.<br/>*   Memory is an example of a preemptable resource.<br/>*   \"A set of processes is deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause.\"<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Readers Writers Problem:**<br/><br/>*   There are two classes of processes: Readers which can run concurrently and writers which need exclusive access.<br/>*   The problem is preventing two writers from being concurrent, preventing a reader and a writer from being concurrent, and permitting readers from being concurrent when no writer is active.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>FINAL EXAM<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\* Paging eliminates external segmentation<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Placement Question:**<br/><br/>Into which hole do we place a process when there are several holes that are big enough?<br/><br/>*   First Fit: Chooses the first eligable hole. First big enough.<br/>*   Best Fit: Chooses the smallest hole that first. Has to go through several times to find best hole.<br/>*   Worst Fit: Pick the largest hole and be done with it. Avoids silvers, but elimates big holes so a big job will require compaction.<br/>*   Next Fit: Same as first fit, but starts looking from where it left off.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Replacement Question:**<br/><br/>Which process should we swap out when we need to free up space in memory?<br/><br/>*   Cannot take the one where Direct Memory Access is scheduled. That one is pinned down.<br/>*   A process that has been blocked for a long time is a good choice.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**(Non-Demand) Paging:**<br/><br/>*   Program is divided into fixed size pieces called (virtual) **pages**. The user cannot see/interact with the partitioning of the program.<br/>*   The physical memory is also divided into what are called **(page) frames**.<br/>*   \\* The size of a page (**the page size**) is equal to the size of a frame (**the frame size**).<br/>*   Each page gets placed inside of a page frame.<br/>*         \\- Since all pages and frames are the same size everything fits perfectly.<br/>*         \\- Everything first perfectly so there's no **external fragmentation**.  <br/>    <br/>*   \\* The program is NOT contiguous in physical memory. The OS keeps a **page table** having an entry for each page.<br/>*         \\- The **page table entry** for page \"p\" contains the frame number \"f\" that contains page \"p\"  <br/>    <br/>*   Properties of non-demand paging:<br/>*         \\- The entire process must be memory resident to run.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The physical address is not contiguous. However the virtual address is.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- No holes, so no external fragmentation.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Non-Demand paging is NO LONGER used.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Internal Fragmentation is possible.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- A job cannot run due to insufficient memory. Eg.) A job is 50 pages but only 40 frames are available.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- There is no placement question with non-demand paging; all frames are equally good since they are the same size.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The replacement question still stands. If a job doesn't fit, another job can be swapped out.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Translate from Virtual to Physical Address:**<br/><br/>*   Virtual Address: \\[ page # | offset \\]<br/>*         \\- **Page Number = (virtual address) / (page size)**  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Offset = (virtual address) mod (page size)**  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The page number is used as an index in the page table. NOT the actual value at that index in the page table.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The value in the page table at the index \\[page #\\] is going to be the frame number for this page.  <br/>    <br/>*   Once we have the frame number, we take that to find the physical address:<br/>*         \\- **Physical Addres = ((frame #) * (frame size)) + offset**<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Ex.) Given a machine with page size PS=FrameSize=1000, what is the physical address (PA) corresponding to the virtual address (VA)=3372?<br/><br/>**=>** PA=(F# * FS) + Offset<br/><br/>FS=1000<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>P# = 3372 / 1000 = 3<br/><br/>Offset = 3372 mod 1000 = 372<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Frame# is the value contained at PageTableEntry\\[P# = 3\\], so we will create an example and say it is 459<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Now we can calculate the physical address:<br/><br/>PA = ((F# * FS) + offset) = (459 * 1000) + 372 = 459372 and we're done :)<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Demand Paging:**<br/><br/>The idea is to fetch pages from disk to memory when they are reference, hoping to get the most actively used pages in memory. Very common despite its complexity.<br/><br/>*   The PTE has the frame number for a page IF it is loaded. But what if it is only on the disk?<br/>*   The PTE has a flag indicating whether or not the page is loaded.<br/>*   When a reference is made to a non-loaded page the system has to do a lot of work.<br/>*         \\- Choose a free frame. If there isn't one, make it.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Choose a victim frame. This is the REplacement question.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Write the victim frame back to the disk if it is dirty.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Update the victim's PTE to show that it is no longer loaded.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Now we have a free frame.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Copy the referenced page from disk to the free frame.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Update the PTE of the reference page to show that it is loaded and insert the frame number.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Page Tables:**<br/><br/>*   We use datain the page table to guide our decision about with page to evict when another page is not already loaded in memory.<br/>*   Put the page table in main memory. This seems slow but it gets sped up by using a Transition Lookaside Buffer.<br/>*   The **\\# of Page Table Entries = # of Pages**<br/>*   The format of a page table entry is machine dependent.<br/>*   A Page Table Entry contains the following data:<br/>*         \\- **The Frame Number:** The field is the main reason for the table. It gives the virtual to physical address translation. The only field for non-demand paging.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Valid Bit:** Tells if the page is currently loaded. It the bit is set, the page is in memory and the frame number for the PTE is valid. If unset, then a page fault is generated by the hardware.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Modified or Dirty Bit:** Indicates that some part of the page has been written since it was loaded (basically unsaved changes). The is needed when the page is evicted so that the OS can tell if the page must be written back to the disk (i.e. saved)  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Referenced or Used Bit:** Indicates that some word in the page has been referenced recently. It is used to select a victim; unreferenced pages make good victims.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- **Protection Bits:**  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Transition Lookaside Buffer (TLB):** An associate memory where the index field if the page number. The other fields include frame number, dirty bit, valid bit, etc. This is small and expensive, however it is very fast.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Page Replacement Algorithms:**<br/><br/>These are solutions to the REplacement problem.<br/><br/>*   **Temporal Locality:** If a word is referenced now, it is likely to be referenced in the near future. This argues for caching referenced words (keeping the referenced word near the processor for a while).<br/>*   **Spacial Locality:** If a word is referenced now, nearby words are likely to be referenced in the near future. This argues for prefeching words around the currently referenced word.<br/><br/>Both of these methods fit under the umbrella idea of \"locality,\" meaning that once a word is referened it is likely to be used again soon.<br/><br/>*   **Belady's Min Algorithm (Optimal Algorithm):**<br/>*         \\- Replace the page whose next reference will be furthest in the future.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Generates the fewest page faults.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Unimplementable because it requires future knowledge of references.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Not Recently Used (NRU):**<br/><br/>Divides the frames into four classes and makes a random selection from the lowest, nonempty class:<br/><br/>1.  Not reference, not modified<br/>2.  Not referenced, modified<br/>3.  Referenced, not modified<br/>4.  Referenced, modified<br/><br/>\\* NRU is based on the belief that a page in a lower priority class is a better victim. In other words, if a page has not been referenced recently, locality suggests that it probably will not be referenced again soon and hence is a good candidate to evict. If a clean page (not modified) is chosen to evict, then the OS does not have to write it back to disk and hence the cost of the eviction is lower than for a dirty page.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**FIFO PRA:**<br/><br/>*   It's just fifo, the first one loaded is the first one evicted.<br/>*   Implementation is to have a queue of nodes each referring ot the resident page.<br/>*         \\- When a page is loaded, a node referring to the page is appended to the tail of the queue.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- When a page needs to be evicted the head node is removed and the page referenced is chosen as the victim.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Second Chance PRA:**<br/><br/>Similar to the FIFO PRA, but altered so that a page recently referenced is given a second chance.<br/><br/>*   When a page is loaded, a node referring to the page is appended to the tail end of the queue.<br/>*   The list is maintained in apparent order of loading. The R bit of the page is cleared.<br/>*   When a page needs to be evicted, the head node is removed and the page referenced is the potential victim.<br/>*   **Case 1:** If the R bit is unset (the page hasn't been referenced recently), then the page is the victim.<br/>*   **Case 2:** If the R bit is set, the page is given a second chance. Specifically, the R bit cleared, the time of loading is changed to NOW, and the node referring to this page is appended to the rear of the queue (so it appears to have just been loaded) and the current head node becomes a potential victim.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Clock PRA:**<br/><br/>Same as 2nd Chance, but uses better implementation, namely a circular list with a single pointer serving as both head and tail pointer.  <br/><br/>We assume that the most common operation is to choose a victim and replace it by a new page.  <br/><br/>*   We use a circular list for the nodes and have a pointer pointing to the head entry. Think of the list as the hours on a clock and the pointer as the hour hand.<br/>*   The operation we need to support efficiently is replace the \"oldest, unreferenced\" page by a given new page.<br/>*   Examine the node pointed to by the clock hand. If the R bit of the corresponding page is set, we give the page a second chance: clear the bit, advance the hand, and examine the next node.<br/>*   Eventually we reach a node whose R bit is clear. The corresponding page is the victim.<br/>*   Replace the victim with the new page.<br/>*   Update the node to refer to this new page.<br/>*   Move the hand forward another hour so that the new page is at near.<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Least Recently Used (LRU):**<br/><br/>When a page fault occurs, choose as victim that page that has been unused for the longest time. Meaning the least recently used one.  <br/><br/>*   Keep a count of how frequently each page is used and evict the one that has the lowest score. Specifically:<br/>*         \\- Include the counter (and reference bit R) in each PTE  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Set the counter to zero when the page is brought into memory.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Every k clocks, perform the following for each PTE:  <br/>    <br/>*               \\- Add R to the counter  <br/>    <br/>*               \\- Clear R  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Choose as victim the PTE with the lowest count.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>\\*\\* Review Deadlock and how to prevent it, what is a safe state, etc.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-L6ZP5ReAFuPVfjUAslR","timestamp":1519955503012,"title":"Operating Systems Final Exam

H.R.S = Hudson River School<br/>2.  A.C.S = Ashcan School<br/>3.  Anything about staircases is most likely by Edward Hopper. You probaly have like an 70-80% chance of getting it right if you guess Hopper for any staircase painting.<br/>4.  Anything involving a \"street scene\" is most likely by George Luks and was probably done between 1900-1910... That's a pretty good guess if you are not sure.  <br/>    <br/>5.  The John Sloan works that you need to know are mostly from 1912.<br/>6.  The ones with a lot of people in a really paintery style are most likely by Orozco and are from 1931 (within 5 years of that).<br/>7.  Colorful silhuette paintings with lots of blues, reds, and oranges are liekly Aaron Douglas and are from 1934.<br/>8.  Any sculptures that are at the Rockefeller center and have like a Roman look to them were made between 1933-1936.<br/><br/>**Important to Know:**<br/><br/>*   Tenth Street Studios at 51 West 10th St. 1857-1956. This is where much of the avante-garde 19th-20th century art work was created. People ate, slept, and worked in their studios.<br/>*   **Hudson River School:** Painters who wanted to stick to traditional art forms.<br/>*   **Ashcan School:** Painters who wanted to paint life as it was, realistically. Palette is usually dark. Started by a group of painters known as \"The Eight.\"<br/>*   View of the Armory Show - 1913<br/>*   Seeing New York with a Cubist: The Rude Descending a Staircase (Rush hour at the subway) - 20 March 1913.... This is supposed to be a political cartoon type of thing about Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending A Staircase.<br/>*   Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art, NYU<br/>*     <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Art Movements:**<br/><br/>*   **Romanticism:** A worshipping of the romance languages. This kind of art is supposed to speak to us. Sensational because it triggers ours senses and makes us feel something.<br/>*   **Impressionism:** Monet, for example. Artists begin with a white background and add color instead of a black background and adding light.<br/>*   **Photography:** Became popular in the 1930s.<br/>*   **Fauvism:** Fauve is French for wild animal. This movement is supposed to be wild and childlike, in an attempt to recapture childhood innocence.<br/>*   **Cubism:** A sort of 4th dimensional look to paintings?<br/><br/>  <br/><br/>**Works to Know (by date):**<br/><br/>*   **Frederic Edwin Church (HRS)** \\- The Heart of the Andes - 1859<br/>*   **James Abbot McNeill Whistler (HRS)** \\- Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket - 1875<br/>*   **Mary Cassatt (HRS)** \\- Little Girl in a Blue Armchair - 1878<br/>*         \\- Influenced by Japanese wood block art.  <br/>    <br/>*   **William Merritt Chase** \\- Interior of the Artist's Studio - 1882<br/>*   **Jacob Riis** \\- Five-Cent Spot - 1888-1889<br/>*   **Childe Hassam** \\- Washington Arch, Spring - 1892<br/>*   **Henry Ossawa Tanner** \\- View of the Seine Looking Toward Nôtre Dame - 1896<br/>*         \\- First African-American artist to gain national acclaim.  <br/>    <br/>*   **John Singer Sargent** \\- Mr. and Mrs. I. N. Phelps Stokes - 1897<br/>*         \\- Very likely a queer artist.

Used sticks, knives, towels, etc.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- A feeling of sublime... Evokes a strong emotion just by looking at it similar to Barnett Newman's Vir Heroicus Sublimis from 1951.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Perfect example of Action Painting.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Painted on the floor  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The canvas was a stage to act.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**George Tooker:**<br/><br/>*   The Subway, 1950:<br/>*         \\- Post war anxiety...

Similar to Jackson Pollock's Number 31.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Possibly addressing his anxiety over being a closeted man.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It looks very messy, like a battlefield. As in, he is fighting his inner demons.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- One of his first \"combines,\" where he takes a traditional canvas and a found object.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Rauschenburg says that painting relates art to life and that he just acts in the space between.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Jasper Johns:**<br/><br/>\\* All about challenging the seriousness and heroic subjectivity of the time.<br/><br/>\\* You think you are so high and mighty and know what the art is about, but you don't.<br/><br/>*   Target with Plaster Casts, 1955:<br/>*         \\- Similar to Charles Demuth's I Saw The Figure 5 in Gold.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Painted box with flaps that open up. Inside are all human body parts.  <br/>    <br/>*   Flag, 1954:<br/>*         \\- During the age of McCarthyism. What does it realy mean to be American?  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- By painting this picture, does that make Johns more American than someone else?<br/>*         \\- There are also news articles in the background of the painting, which relates to the news in America.  <br/>    <br/>*   Painted Bronze, 1960:<br/>*         \\- You think you know what you're looking at but you don't.  <br/>    <br/>*         -  <br/>    <br/>*   False Start, 1959:<br/>*         \\- Again an example of thinking you know something but you don't.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is a bunch of color splotches, but each one has the name of a different color than it is painted in.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Again, not taking art too seriously and being ironic.  <br/>    <br/>*   Painting with Two Balls, 1960:<br/>*         \\- Yes, this is a sexual reference. The painting literally \"has balls.\" Johns was trying to be funny.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Alluding to his sexuality in this painting.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is about the arise of gay visual asthetic that came with the demise of AbEx  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Yvonne Rainer:**<br/><br/>*   The Mind is a Muscle, 1966:<br/>*         \\- The Judson Dance Theater at the Memorial Church of the same name.<br/><br/>**Claes Oldenburg:**<br/><br/>*   The Street, 1960:<br/>*         \\- At Judson Gallery  <br/>    <br/>*         -  <br/>    <br/>*   The Store, 1961:<br/>*         \\- All art galleries are just a store, so why not call them for what they are?  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- They're literally just people going around, seeing what they like, and buying it.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Showed the influence that consumerism had on the art world.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Lisette Model:**<br/><br/>*   War Rally, 1941-45:<br/>*         \\- Supposed to show a proud, true American.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- He is standing tall and holding an American flag.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- During the time of McCarthyism, people wanted nationalism.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Helen Levitt:**<br/><br/>*   New York, 1940:<br/>*         \\- A very dynamic photo of children in the city.<br/>*         \\- The importance of this photo is how Levitt captures so much action.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is very difficult to do this ^. The Winogrand Tilt is also present here.  <br/>    <br/>*   Kids with Masks, 11940:<br/>*         \\- Another example of dynamic photography.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- All the kids are posed so interstingly, but none of it is one purpose.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is the natural essence of childhood. The inherent grace of childhood.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Roy DeCarava:**<br/><br/>*   Graduation, 1949:<br/>*         -  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Garry Winogrand:**<br/><br/>*   World's Fair, New York, 1964:<br/>*         \\- Very dynamic. Everyone has their own story.<br/>*         \\- Related to Jackson Pollock's \"One: Number 31\" because of there is so much going on.  <br/>    <br/>*   Demonstration outside Madison Square Garden, New York, 1968:<br/>*         \\- Again, extremely dynamic. You just want to know everyone's story.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Just by nature, everyone in the photo is wearing glasses.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Diane Arbus:**<br/><br/>*   Triplets in their bedroom, N.J., 1963:<br/>*         \\- Very square photography style, opposite of Winogrand.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Style was developed at The New School under her studies under Lisette Model<br/>*   Two Ladies at the Automat, NYC, 1966:<br/>*         \\- Another square photo  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Somewhat of a sad style to her photos.  <br/>    <br/>*   A young Brooklyn family going for a Sunday outing, NYC, 1966:<br/>*         \\- A very sad looking photo, as per her usual style.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The parents look very serious, as in they are upset that this is their life now.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The children seem to be a heavy burden for them.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- They look like the kinds of people who like to go out and adventure, but having children has made them take a step away from that life.  <br/>    <br/>*   Child with toy hand grenade in Central Park, 1962:<br/>*         \\- The photo makes it look like the boy is going to do something bad.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- It is all about context, when you see the rest of the photo shoot.  <br/>    <br/><br/>**Andy Warhol:**<br/><br/>*   Saturday's Popeye, 1961:<br/>*         \\- Referencing the comic book/tv character Popeye  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Art does not have to be so serious as it was for Warhol's predecesors.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Wanted to make art accessible for everyone. What better way to do that than with Popeye?  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- TV and mass media was becoming huge, which meant that this kind of art became more popular.  <br/>    <br/>*   Campell's Tomato Soup, 1962:<br/>*         \\- Created in steps. First a pencil stencil (no, he did not draw each one scratch). Then he hand painted the can and label. Finally, the gold fleur-de-lis were made using a stamp.<br/>*         \\- What is interesting is that each can is still different. They are different flavors of soup (tomato, chicken, etc.). They also vary slightly in tone.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The number of canvases relates to the mass production of actual soup cans. It is supposed to be like a grocery store, where everyone can pick one up and take it home.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- They are, in grid style, arranged in order of introduction. So Campell's Tomato soup comes first.  <br/>    <br/>*   Gold Marilyn Monroe, 1962:<br/>*         \\- Hugely iconic painting of his. Inspired many other works today such as Madonna's album cover.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Warhol made many works similar to this. He would exaggerate the colors and tones though.  <br/>    <br/>*   Ether Scull 36 Times, 1963:<br/>*         \\- Warhol's first commissioned work.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- Scull was the wife of an art collector and Warhol created lots of different images of her with different colors and in different poses.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- A photobooth style effect.  <br/>    <br/>*   Blue Electric Chair, 1963:<br/>*         \\- Warhol may have had a sort of interest with the deaths of people.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- The electric chair is not a happy thing, but he makes it easier to look at by coloring the scene blue and putting a solid blue panel right next to it.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- He put two panels on it because it made him more money.  <br/>    <br/>*   Empire, 1964:<br/>*         \\- He was also a film maker. This film was 8 hours long and just featured the Empire State Building changing throughout the day. Yes, that was the whole movie.  <br/>    <br/>*         \\- He did this because he wanted people to talk, get up, get food, etc. while they were watching it.","creator":"D49o10TJEQOAnZbgjYLYJtOGnon2","id":"-LBCa0GN2icf6xzsDAwx","timestamp":1524941460593,"title":"Expressive Cultures Final Review"},"-LBDEFVkGAhIPsbbegt6":{"notebook":"-fdsafliU278nj","content":"1.

This lets you define integers in a different range than -2B - 2B.

CANNOT be part of the operating system because it has to work for different programming languages.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>Switch Statements:  <br/>  <br/>\\- Switch statements only work for ints and chars. They do not work for floats, arrays, doubles, etc.  <br/>  <br/>\\- You can't do \"and\" in a switch case. You can do \"or\" by typing...  <br/>  <br/>switch(something) {  <br/>  <br/>case 1:  <br/>  <br/>case 7: \\*something\\* break;  <br/>  <br/>}  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>\\* Memory slots are only big enough to hold **1 BYTE**.

For example, if you set an integer to greater than or less than it's bounds, you will get an incorrect number that will not be easily found when debugging your code.  <br/>\\* We need the assembler so that **professional programmers can optimize their code by comparing the assembly to high level code** and also because the **compiler and assembler do two different jobs and do not need to be mixed together to add complication**.  <br/>\\* The Assembler is **machine dependent**.  <br/>\\* Checks if a number is odd: (_a++) & 0x1  <br/>_The compiler is both **machine and language dependent**.  <br/>\\* REMEMBER: a << 3 = 2^3_a  <br/>_Know how to convert signed, unsigned, hexadecimal, binary, decimal, all that mess...  <br/>\\* Review the last question on the midterm fall 16  <br/>  <br/>\\* If the Carry Flag is 1 for unsigned numbers then there is an overflow.
